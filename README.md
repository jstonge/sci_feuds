# Scientific Feuds: where to draw the line

## Feuds origin story

#### Nature of the Universe: Steady State vs. Big Bang Theory 

#physics

> This debate arose in the mid-20th century, with two competing theories: the Steady State theory, which suggested the universe has no beginning or end, and the Big Bang theory, which argues the universe began with a massive explosion.


#### The Structure of DNA: Double Helix

#biology

> The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 was controversial, as multiple scientists were racing to determine the molecule's structure, which ultimately laid the foundation for modern genetics.



#### The Nature vs. Nurture Debate

#sociology

> This debate revolves around the extent to which human behavior, traits, and abilities are determined by genetics (nature) or by social and environmental factors (nurture).


#### Structural Functionalism vs. Conflict Theory

#sociology

> The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been the subject of intense debate. While some ecologists argue that biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and functioning, others contend that a few key species can sustain ecosystem processes




#### Individual Agency vs. Social Structure

#sociolgy

> This debate addresses the extent to which individuals have the freedom to make choices and shape their lives versus the extent to which social structures (e.g., institutions, norms, and economic systems) constrain and determine individuals' behavior.


#### Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning

#ecology

> The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been the subject of intense debate. While some ecologists argue that biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and functioning, others contend that a few key species can sustain ecosystem processes.


#### Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH)

#ecology

> The IDH posits that local species diversity is maximized when ecological disturbance is neither too rare nor too frequent. However, the hypothesis has been contested, with some arguing that empirical evidence does not consistently support it.



#### The Trophic Cascades vs. Bottom-Up Control debate

#ecology

> Trophic cascades suggest that the presence or absence of top predators can have cascading effects on lower trophic levels, leading to changes in ecosystem structure and function. In contrast, the bottom-up control hypothesis emphasizes the role of resource availability (e.g., nutrients, light) in determining ecosystem structure, with primary producers at the base of the food web governing the biomass and diversity of higher trophic levels.


#### The Hubbell's Neutral Theory vs. Niche Theory

#ecology

> The neutral theory of biodiversity, proposed by Stephen Hubbell, posits that the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities are largely the result of random processes, such as migration, birth, and death, rather than species-specific traits. In contrast, niche theory suggests that species coexist in ecosystems because they occupy distinct niches and have specific adaptations that allow them to exploit different resources.


#### The Role of Keystone Species

#ecology

> The concept of keystone species refers to species that have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their abundance. However, there has been debate over the criteria for identifying keystone species and the extent to which they actually drive ecosystem dynamics.

#### The Stability of Personality Traits

> This debate concerns whether personality traits remain stable throughout a person's life or change significantly over time. Some researchers argue that traits are relatively consistent, while others maintain that they can change due to various factors, such as life events or age.

#### The Influence of Birth Order on Personality

> This debate examines whether a person's birth order (i.e., being the firstborn, middle child, or youngest) has a significant impact on their personality, intelligence, and life outcomes.

#### The Role of Emotions in Decision-Making: Rational vs. Emotional

> This debate revolves around the extent to which decision-making is driven by rational, cognitive processes or by emotional factors. Some researchers argue that emotions can cloud judgment, while others suggest that emotions are essential for adaptive decision-making.

#### Behaviorism vs. Cognitive Psychology

> This debate revolves around the best way to study human behavior and mental processes. Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and their relationships with environmental stimuli, while cognitive psychology investigates the internal mental processes underlying behavior.

#### The Nature of Intelligence: Unitary vs. Multiple Intelligences

> The nature of intelligence has long been debated, with some researchers arguing for a single, general intelligence factor (g), while others propose the existence of multiple intelligences.

#### Free Will vs. Determinism

> This ongoing debate addresses whether human behavior is governed by free will or is determined by factors such as genetics, environment, and unconscious processes.

#### Psychoanalysis vs. Behaviorism

> This debate concerns the most appropriate approach to understanding and treating mental disorders. Psychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud, emphasizes the role of unconscious desires and conflicts, while behaviorism, championed by John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, focuses on observable behaviors and learning principles.

#### Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)



#### Artificial Intelligence: AI Alignment and Existential Risk



#### Climate Science: Anthropogenic Climate Change



#### The Safety and Regulation of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)

> Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that interfere with the normal function of the endocrine (hormonal) system in humans and animals. Many EDCs are found in everyday products, such as plastics, pesticides, and personal care products. There has been an ongoing debate over the safety, regulation, and testing of these chemicals, with concerns about their potential impact on human health and the environment.


#### Stability criterion for non-equilibrium states

> There have been debates and questions about the range of validity and the universal applicability of the Glansdorff-Prigogine criterion. Some researchers have raised concerns about the criterion's limitations and applicability, particularly in systems that are far from equilibrium or exhibit complex behavior.

#### The Mechanism of the Lithium-Oxygen Battery

> Lithium-oxygen batteries are considered promising for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density. However, the detailed reaction mechanism at the oxygen electrode is still under debate. Researchers are divided on whether the discharge product is lithium peroxide (Li2O2) or lithium superoxide (LiO2), which has implications for understanding the battery's performance and devising strategies for improvement.

#### The Existence and Stability of Element 118: Oganesson (Og)

> The discovery of element 118, oganesson, in 2002 was met with skepticism due to controversies surrounding earlier claims about superheavy elements. Oganesson is a synthetic element and a member of Group 18 in the periodic table, which includes noble gases. It challenges our understanding of the periodic table because its electron structure and chemical properties may differ significantly from those of other noble gases due to relativistic effects.


#### Cold Fusion

> In 1989, electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons claimed to have observed cold fusion, a nuclear reaction that supposedly occurred at room temperature. This challenged the prevailing understanding of nuclear reactions, which were believed to require extremely high temperatures. However, many scientists have been unable to reproduce the results, leading to skepticism about the validity of cold fusion.

#### Biomedical Science: Embryonic Stem Cell Research

> Embryonic stem cell research has generated considerable controversy due to ethical concerns surrounding the use of human embryos. Supporters of the research argue that it has the potential to lead to groundbreaking therapies for various diseases, while opponents believe that the destruction of human embryos for research is morally wrong.

#### Dark Matter vs. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)

> The nature of dark matter and its role in the universe has been a source of debate among astronomers and astrophysicists. The standard model posits that dark matter, an invisible form of matter, makes up a significant portion of the universe's mass. However, some researchers propose Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) as an alternative explanation for the observed gravitational effects, without the need for dark matter.

#### Nutrition Science: Low-Fat vs. Low-Carbohydrate Diets

> The debate between low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets has generated heated discussions among nutritionists, dieticians, and the general public. Proponents of each diet claim that their approach is superior for weight loss, heart health, and overall well-being. However, research on the topic is often conflicting, leading to confusion and disagreement.

#### Neuroscience: The Nature of Consciousness

> The nature of consciousness and the neural basis for subjective experience have been subjects of intense debate among neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers. Some researchers propose that consciousness arises from specific neural correlates, while others argue for more complex, emergent properties of the brain. Panpsychism, a philosophical perspective that posits consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe, has also gained attention in recent years.

#### Genetic Engineering: Gene Editing and CRISPR-Cas9

> The advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized genetic engineering and sparked significant debate over its ethical and social implications. The ease and precision of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing have raised concerns about potential misuse, designer babies, and unintended consequences of altering the human germline. While some researchers emphasize the potential benefits of the technology, such as curing genetic diseases, others argue for caution and strict regulation.

#### Paleontology: The Extinction of Dinosaurs

> The exact cause of the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs around 65 million years ago remains a topic of debate among paleontologists. The prevailing hypothesis is that a massive asteroid impact led to a chain of events that ultimately caused the extinction. However, some researchers argue that volcanic activity or other factors played a more significant role in the extinction event.

#### The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

> The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been a longstanding debate among physicists. The Copenhagen interpretation, which was the dominant view for much of the 20th century, posits that quantum systems exist in a superposition of states until they are measured, at which point their state collapses to a definite outcome. However, alternative interpretations, such as the many-worlds interpretation and the pilot-wave theory, have gained traction and challenge the conventional view.

#### Group Selection vs. Kin Selection

#EvolutionaryBiology

> The debate between group selection and kin selection centers on the levels at which natural selection operates. Group selection proposes that natural selection can favor traits that are beneficial to the group, even if they are detrimental to an individual, while kin selection focuses on the role of genetic relatedness in the evolution of altruistic behaviors. The debate remains unresolved, with some researchers advocating for a multi-level selection approach.

#### The Influence of Nature vs. Nurture

#psychology

> The nature vs. nurture debate is a longstanding controversy in psychology, focusing on the relative contributions of genetic inheritance and environmental factors in determining human traits and behavior. While some researchers emphasize the importance of genetic predispositions, others argue that environmental influences play a more significant role in shaping our behavior. Advances in genetics and epigenetics have helped to reveal the complex interplay between genes and environment.

#### Animal Consciousness and Sentience

#animalCognition

> The question of animal consciousness and sentience has been a topic of heated debate among researchers in animal cognition, neuroscience, and philosophy. Some argue that certain animals, such as mammals and birds, possess a degree of consciousness similar to humans, while others claim that animal behavior can be explained through simpler mechanisms, without invoking consciousness. The debate has significant implications for animal welfare and ethical considerations in research and agriculture.
