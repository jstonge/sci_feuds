# Scientific Feuds: where to draw the line

## Feuds origin story

#### Nature of the Universe: Steady State vs. Big Bang Theory 

#physics

> This debate arose in the mid-20th century, with two competing theories: the Steady State theory, which suggested the universe has no beginning or end, and the Big Bang theory, which argues the universe began with a massive explosion.


#### The Structure of DNA: Double Helix

#biology

> The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953 was controversial, as multiple scientists were racing to determine the molecule's structure, which ultimately laid the foundation for modern genetics.



#### The Nature vs. Nurture Debate

#sociology

> This debate revolves around the extent to which human behavior, traits, and abilities are determined by genetics (nature) or by social and environmental factors (nurture).


#### Structural Functionalism vs. Conflict Theory

#sociology

> The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been the subject of intense debate. While some ecologists argue that biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and functioning, others contend that a few key species can sustain ecosystem processes




#### Individual Agency vs. Social Structure

#sociolgy

> This debate addresses the extent to which individuals have the freedom to make choices and shape their lives versus the extent to which social structures (e.g., institutions, norms, and economic systems) constrain and determine individuals' behavior.


#### Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning

#ecology

> The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been the subject of intense debate. While some ecologists argue that biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and functioning, others contend that a few key species can sustain ecosystem processes.


#### Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH)

#ecology

> The IDH posits that local species diversity is maximized when ecological disturbance is neither too rare nor too frequent. However, the hypothesis has been contested, with some arguing that empirical evidence does not consistently support it.



#### The Trophic Cascades vs. Bottom-Up Control debate

#ecology

> Trophic cascades suggest that the presence or absence of top predators can have cascading effects on lower trophic levels, leading to changes in ecosystem structure and function. In contrast, the bottom-up control hypothesis emphasizes the role of resource availability (e.g., nutrients, light) in determining ecosystem structure, with primary producers at the base of the food web governing the biomass and diversity of higher trophic levels.


#### The Hubbell's Neutral Theory vs. Niche Theory

#ecology

> The neutral theory of biodiversity, proposed by Stephen Hubbell, posits that the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities are largely the result of random processes, such as migration, birth, and death, rather than species-specific traits. In contrast, niche theory suggests that species coexist in ecosystems because they occupy distinct niches and have specific adaptations that allow them to exploit different resources.


#### The Role of Keystone Species

#ecology

> The concept of keystone species refers to species that have a disproportionately large effect on their environment relative to their abundance. However, there has been debate over the criteria for identifying keystone species and the extent to which they actually drive ecosystem dynamics.
