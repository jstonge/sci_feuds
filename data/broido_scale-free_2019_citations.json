In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems, detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address three main challenges associated with this problem: i). how to compare graph snapshots across time, ii). how to capture temporal dependencies, and iii). how to combine different views of a temporal graph. To solve the above challenges, we first propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of graph Laplacian as the low dimensional embedding of the graph structure at each snapshot. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. Next, we propose MultiLAD, a simple and effective generalization of LAD to multi-view graphs. MultiLAD provides the first change point detection method for multi-view dynamic graphs. It aggregates the singular values of the normalized graph Laplacian from different views through the scalar power mean operation. Through extensive synthetic experiments, we show that i). LAD and MultiLAD are accurate and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and their multi-view extensions by a large margin, ii). MultiLAD's advantage over contenders significantly increases when additional views are available, and iii). MultiLAD is highly robust to noise from individual views. In five real world dynamic graphs, we demonstrate that LAD and MultiLAD identify significant events as top anomalies such as the implementation of government COVID-19 interventions which impacted the population mobility in multi-view traffic networks.", "venue": "ArXiv", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-02", "authors": [{"authorId": "51012317", "name": "Shenyang Huang"}, {"authorId": "1410349378", "name": "Samy Coulombe"}, {"authorId": "1396196837", "name": "Yasmeen Hitti"}, {"authorId": "2490772", "name": "Reihaneh Rabbany"}, {"authorId": "2123387257", "name": "Guillaume Rabusseau"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "2feb223e4cbf054b390f3988ad512e2bfdefacc7", "corpusId": 254213873, "title": "Signatures of capacity development through research collaborations in artificial intelligence and machine learning", "abstract": null, "venue": "Jurnal Informa", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "2148285646", "name": "Vinayak"}, {"authorId": "2193436209", "name": "Adarsh Raghuvanshi"}, {"authorId": "1718689", "name": "A.

These signals are generated over time through a linear diffusion process, where neighboring nodes exchange messages according to the underlying network topology, and aggregate them according to a certain combination matrix. We consider the demanding setting of graph learning under partial observability, where signals are available only from a limited fraction of nodes, and we want to establish whether the topology of these nodes can be estimated faithfully, despite the presence of possibly many latent nodes. Recent results examined this problem when the network topology is generated according to an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random model. However, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs feature homogeneity across nodes and independence across edges, while, over several real-world networks, significant heterogeneity is observed between very connected \u201chubs\u201d and scarcely connected peripheral nodes, and the edge construction process entails significant dependencies across edges. Preferential attachment random graphs were conceived primarily to fill these gaps. We tackle the problem of graph learning over preferential attachment graphs by focusing on the following setting: first-order vector autoregressive models equipped with a stable Laplacian combination matrix, and a network topology drawn according to the popular Bollob\u00e1s-Riordan preferential attachment model.

Next, we adapt our \ufb01ne-grained approach to enable scalable parallelisation of state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal and hop-constrained cycle enumeration. Our evaluation on a cluster with 256 physical cores demonstrates a near-linear scalability of our \ufb01ne-grained parallel algorithms when enumerating all the aforementioned types of cycles.

Abstract Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) are the basis for understanding most cellular events in biological systems. Several experimental methods, e.g., biochemical, molecular, and genetic methods, have been used to identify protein\u2013protein associations. However, some of them, such as mass spectrometry, are time-consuming and expensive. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used to characterize PPIs, increasing the number of proteins analyzed simultaneously and optimizing time and resources for identifying and predicting protein\u2013protein functional linkages. Previous ML approaches have focused on well-known networks or specific targets but not on identifying relevant proteins with partial or null knowledge of the interaction networks. The proposed approach aims to generate a relevant protein sequence based on bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) with partial knowledge of interactions. The general framework comprises conducting a scale-free and fractal complex network analysis. The outcome of these analyses is then used to fine-tune the fractal method for the vital protein extraction of PPI networks. The results show that several PPI networks are self-similar or fractal, but that both features cannot coexist.

For mutations that impact gene expression, mutations acting in cis have been hypothesized to generally be less pleiotropic than mutations affecting the same gene's expression in trans, suggesting that cis-regulatory mutations should be less deleterious and more likely to fix over evolutionary time. Here, we use expression and fitness data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion strains to test these hypotheses. By treating deletion of each gene as a cis-regulatory mutation affecting its own expression and deletions of other genes affecting expression of this focal gene as trans-regulatory mutations, we find that cis-acting mutations do indeed tend to be less pleiotropic than trans-acting mutations affecting expression of the same gene. This pattern was observed for the vast majority of genes in the data set and could be explained by the topology of the regulatory network controlling gene expression.

For various proposed generative models, a majority of them build the graph by sequentially adding each node and the attached edges. However, the growth of many real-world graphs, such as social networks, is naturally modeled by the sequential insertion of edges. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no generative model has been proposed to reveal this process. We propose the first sequence-of-edges model, denoted as temporal preferential attachment (TPA). It relies on preferential attachment (PA), one of the most influential mechanisms to generate scale-free graphs, and takes time-decay effect and node fitness into consideration. Empirical analysis demonstrates that our model preserves several key properties of the real-world graphs, including both the properties observed from the snapshot graphs (e.g., power-law distribution) and temporal properties observed from the graph generation process (e.g., shrinking diameter).

However, it has not yet been well understand how the structural property in different network models intrinsically determines de-anonymizability. We address the above issue in this paper by making the two contributions: (i) We discover that the automorphic degree and homomorphic degree of social networks determine their de-anonymizability universally. The automorphic degree characterizes the distinguishability of the users in a network, while the homomorphic degree models the similarities of users between two networks. We conclude that a smaller automorphic degree and a larger homomorphic degree conduce to a higher de-anonymizability. Such model-independent phenomenon refreshes us with a latitudinal study as it generalizes the essential commonness of de-anonymization in different network models. (ii) We derive explicit parametric bounds of the de-anonymizability for three classic network models, showing that such bounds correspond well to our conclusion about morphism property.

Here we address the following question: to what extent does the scale-free nature of economic networks and the vulnerability of the biggest nodes affect the propagation of economic shocks? We model the dynamics of bankruptcies as the propagation of financial contagion across the banking sector over a scale-free network of banks, and perform Monte-Carlo simulations based on synthetic networks. In addition, we analyze the public data regarding the bankruptcy of US banks from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The dynamics of the shock propagation is characterized in terms of the Bank Failures Diffusion Index, i.e., the average number of new bankruptcies triggered by the bankruptcy of a single bank, and in terms of the Shannon entropy of the whole network.

For the graph-level representation, it is important to learn both representation of neighboring nodes, i.e., aggregation, and graph structural information. A number of graph pooling methods have been developed for this goal. However, most of the existing pooling methods utilize k-hop neighborhood without considering explicit structural information in a graph. In this paper, we propose Structure Prototype Guided Pooling (SPGP) that utilizes prior graph structures to overcome the limitation. SPGP formulates graph structures as learnable prototype vectors and computes the af\ufb01nity between nodes and prototype vectors. This leads to a novel node scoring scheme that prioritizes informative nodes while encapsulating the useful structures of the graph.

Summary We propose a novel graph pooling method, SPGP, for graph-level classi\ufb01cation. The key to success of SPGP is the consideration of informative global graph structures to obtain accurate graph-level representations. The structure prototypes guide the node scoring scheme during pooling. Experiments on multiple datasets and ablation studies show that utilization of the prior graph structures achieves better performance than existing pooling methods. In this study, two well-known structures in graph theory, BCC and cliques are utilized as the prior graph structures.

These robust laws indicate that power-law networks with diverging variance are among the most extreme networks in terms of correlation and clustering, building a further theoretical foundation for the widely reported scale-free network phenomena such as correlation and clustering decay.", "venue": "Physical Review E", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13532", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Physics", "Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-29", "authors": [{"authorId": "2183212863", "name": "Judith Brugman"}, {"authorId": "11131924", "name": "J.

Real-world network datasets contain fine features on their edges, which are usually represented as edge weights, to reflect the strength of the connection. However, to remove spurious connections and understand the topological structure, network edges are usually represented as binary states, being either connected or not. This is still a controversial issue about how to infer binary adjacency matrices from edge weight distribution. Usually, it is achieved by simply thresholding to distinguish true links and to obtain a set of sparse connections. Previously, tools developed in statistical mechanics have provided effective ways to find the optimal threshold so as to maintain the statistical properties in the network structure. Thermodynamic analogies together with statistical ensembles have been proved to be useful in analysing edge-weighted networks. To extend this work, in this paper, we use Debye\u2019s solid model to describe the probability distribution of edge weights. This models the distribution of edge weights using the mixed Gamma distribution. We treat the derived edge-weight distribution as the combination of two Gamma functions and then apply the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the corresponding parameters. This gives the optimal threshold to convert weighted networks to binary connections. Numerical analysis shows that Debye\u2019s solid model provides a new way to describe the edge weight probability. Moreover, there exists a phase transition in the low-temperature region, corresponding to a structural transition caused by applying the threshold. Experimental results on real-world weighted networks reveal an improved threshold performance for inferring edge connections from edge weights.", "venue": "International Conference on Pattern Recognition", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 27, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-21", "authors": [{"authorId": "7898970", "name": "Jianjia Wang"}, {"authorId": "2145735178", "name": "Xin Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2193068727", "name": "Chong Wu"}, {"authorId": "1679753", "name": "E.

We use preferential attachment and network dismantling strategies to evaluate their importance for the network structure. Subsequently, we expand our view to all ERC-20 tokens issued on the Ethereum network. We first study multilayered networks composed of Ether (ETH) and individual tokens using a dismantling approach to assess how the deconstruction starting from one network affects the other. Finally, we analyse the Ether network and Ethereum-based token networks to find similarities between sets of high-degree nodes. For this purpose, we use both the traditional Jaccard Index and a new metric that we introduce, the Ordered Jaccard Index (OJI), which considers the order of the elements in the two sets that are compared. Our findings suggest that smart contracts and exchange-related addresses play a structural role in transaction networks both in DeFi and Ethereum. The presence in the network of nodes associated to addresses of smart contracts and exchanges is positively correlated with the success of the token network measured in terms of network size and market capitalisation.

Despite intensive utilization of the topological feature in this task, it is unclear to what extent a particular feature can be leveraged to infer missing links.

Recent advances in protein engineering and microscopy have together led to a paradigm shift in neuroscience; using fluorescence, we can now image the activity of every neuron through the whole brain of behaving animals. Even in larger organisms, the number of neurons that we can record simultaneously is increasing exponentially with time. This increase in the dimensionality of the data is being met with an explosion of computational and mathematical methods, each using disparate terminology, distinct approaches, and diverse mathematical concepts. Here we collect, organize, and explain multiple data analysis techniques that have been, or could be, applied to whole-brain imaging, using larval zebrafish as an example model. We begin with methods such as linear regression that are designed to detect relations between two variables. Next, we progress through network science and applied topological methods, which focus on the patterns of relations among many variables. Finally, we highlight the potential of generative models that could provide testable hypotheses on wiring rules and network progression through time, or disease progression. While we use examples of imaging from larval zebrafish, these approaches are suitable for any population-scale neural network modeling, and indeed, to applications beyond systems neuroscience. Computational approaches from network science and applied topology are not limited to larval zebrafish, or even to systems neuroscience, and we therefore conclude with a discussion of how such methods can be applied to diverse problems across the biological sciences.", "venue": "Network Neuroscience", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 194, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "114088426", "name": "A.

The goal is to find a smaller version of the system whose time evolution is easier to predict while preserving some of the key dynamical features of the original system. Finding such a reduced representation for complex systems is, however, a difficult task. We address this problem for dynamics on weighted directed networks, with special emphasis on modular and heterogeneous networks. We propose a two-step dimension-reduction method that takes into account the properties of the adjacency matrix. First, units are partitioned into groups of similar connectivity profiles. Each group is associated to an observable that is a weighted average of the nodes\u2019 activities within the group. Second, we derive a set of conditions that must be fulfilled for these observables to properly represent the original system\u2019s behavior, together with a method for approximately solving them. The result is a reduced adjacency matrix and an approximate system of ODEs for the observables\u2019 evolution. We show that the reduced system can be used to predict some characteristic features of the complete dynamics for different types of connectivity structures, both synthetic and derived from real data, including neuronal, ecological, and social networks. Our formalism opens a way to a systematic comparison of the effect of various structural properties on the overall network dynamics. It can thus help to identify the main structural driving forces guiding the evolution of dynamical processes on networks.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Physics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "2172191297", "name": "Marina Vegu'e"}, {"authorId": "134852795", "name": "Vincent Thibeault"}, {"authorId": "2096311", "name": "P.

Through secretion of insulin and other hormones they regulate postprandial storage and interprandial usage of energy-rich nutrients. In these clusters of hormone-secreting endocrine cells, intricate cell-cell communication is essential for proper function. Electrical coupling between the insulin-secreting beta cells through gap junctions composed of connexin36 is particularly important, as it provides the required, most important, basis for coordinated responses of the beta cell population. The increasing evidence that gap-junctional communication and its modulation are vital to well-regulated secretion of insulin has stimulated immense interest in how subpopulations of heterogeneous beta cells are functionally arranged throughout the islets and how they mediate intercellular signals. In the last decade, several novel techniques have been proposed to assess cooperation between cells in islets, including the prosperous combination of multicellular imaging and network science. In the present contribution, we review recent advances related to the application of complex network approaches to uncover the functional connectivity patterns among cells within the islets. We first provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles of network theory, enumerating the measures characterizing the intercellular interactions and quantifying the functional integration and segregation of a multicellular system. Then we describe methodological approaches to construct functional beta cell networks, point out possible pitfalls, and specify the functional implications of beta cell network examinations. We continue by highlighting the recent findings obtained through advanced multicellular imaging techniques supported by network-based analyses, giving special emphasis to the current developments in both mouse and human islets, as well as outlining challenges offered by the multilayer network formalism in exploring the collective activity of islet cell populations. Finally, we emphasize that the combination of these imaging techniques and network-based analyses does not only represent an innovative concept that can be used to describe and interpret the physiology of islets, but also provides fertile ground for delineating normal from pathological function and for quantifying the changes in islet communication networks associated with the development of diabetes mellitus.", "venue": "Frontiers in Endocrinology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 317, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922640/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-06-15", "authors": [{"authorId": "47146477", "name": "A.

I apply this approach to simulate the behavior of animal space use under the influence of memory and site fidelity. Based on the parsimonious Multi-scaled random walk model (MRW) an emergent property of self-reinforcing returns to a subset of historic locations shows how a network of nodes grows into an increased hierarchical depth of site fidelity. While most locations along a movement path may have a low revisit probability, habitat selection is maturing with respect to utilization of the most visited patches, in particular for patches that emerge during the early phase of node development. Using simulations with default MRW properties, which have been shown to produce space use in close statistical compliance with utilization distributions of many species of mammals, I illustrate how a shifting spatio-temporal mosaic of habitat utilization may be described statistically and given behavioral-ecological interpretation. The proposed method is illustrated with a pilot study using black bear Ursus americanus telemetry fixes. One specific parameter, the Characteristic Scale of Space Use, is here shown to express strong resilience against shifting site fidelity. This robust result may seem counter-intuitive, but is logical under the premise of the MRW model and its relationship to site fidelity, whether stable or shifting spatially over time. Thus, spatial analysis of the dynamics of a gradually drifting site fidelity using simulated scenarios may indirectly cast light on the dynamics of movement behavior as preferred patches are shifting over time. Both aspects of complex space use, network topology and dynamically drifting dispersion of site fidelity, provide in tandem important descriptors of behavioral ecology with relevance to habitat selection.", "venue": "Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 60, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.695854/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Environmental Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-06-06", "authors": [{"authorId": "5450065", "name": "Arild O.

Investigating the resulting disturbance in network properties is quintessential to understand real networks in action. The removal of nodes is a representative disturbance, but previous studies are seemingly contrasting about its effect on arguably the most fundamental network statistic, the degree distribution. The key question is about the functional form of the degree distributions that can be altered during node removal or sampling. The functional form is decisive in the remaining subnetwork's static and dynamical properties. In this work, we clarify the situation by utilizing the relative entropies with respect to the reference distributions in the Poisson and power-law form, to quantify the distance between the subnetwork's degree distribution and either of the reference distributions. Introducing general sequential node removal processes with continuously different levels of hub protection to encompass a series of scenarios including uniform random removal and preferred or protective (i.e., biased random) removal of the hub, we classify the altered degree distributions starting from various power-law forms by comparing two relative entropy values.

In this work, we propose the hypothesis that the centrality of the different brain nodes in the human connectome is a product of their embryogenic age, and accordingly, early-born nodes should display higher hubness, and viceversa for late-born nodes. We tested our hypothesis by identifying and segmenting eighteen macroregions with a well-known embryogenic age, over which we calculated nodes\u2019 centrality in the structural and functional networks at different spatial resolutions. First, nodes\u2019 structural centrality correlated with their embryogenic age, fully confirming our working hypothesis. However, at the functional level, distinct trends were found at different resolutions. Secondly, the difference in embryonic age between nodes inversely correlated with the probability of existence and the weights of the links. This indicated the presence of a temporal developmental gradient that shapes connectivity and where nodes connect more to nodes with a similar age. Finally, brain transcriptomic analysis revealed high association between embryonic age, structural-functional centrality and the expression of genes related to nervous system development and synapse regulation. Furthermore, the spatial expression of genes causally related to major neurological diseases was highly correlated with spatial maps of region centrality.

The clinical symptoms of preeclampsia are well recognized, however, the precise molecular mechanisms leading to the disorder are poorly understood. This is compounded by the heterogeneous nature of preeclampsia onset, timing and severity. Indeed a multitude of poorly defined causes including genetic components implicates etiologic factors, such as immune maladaptation, placental ischemia and increased oxidative stress. Large datasets generated by microarray and next-generation sequencing have enabled the comprehensive study of preeclampsia at the molecular level. However, computational approaches to simultaneously analyze the preeclampsia transcriptomic and network data and identify clinically relevant information are currently limited. In this paper, we proposed a control theory method to identify potential preeclampsia-associated genes based on both transcriptomic and network data. First, we built a preeclampsia gene regulatory network and analyzed its controllability. We then defined two types of critical preeclampsia-associated genes that play important roles in the constructed preeclampsia-specific network. Benchmarking against differential expression, betweenness centrality and hub analysis we demonstrated that the proposed method may offer novel insights compared with other standard approaches.

The Criticism is Complete Nonsense", "abstract": "Ordinary least-squares estimation is proved to be the best linear unbiased estimator according to the Gauss-Markov theorem. In the last two decades, however, some researchers criticized that least-squares was substantially inaccurate in fitting power-law distributions; such criticism has caused a strong bias in research community. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to rebut that such criticism is complete nonsense. Specifically, we sample different sizes of discrete and continuous data from power-law models, showing that even though the long-tailed noises are sampled from power-law models, they cannot be treated as power-law data. We define the correct way to bin continuous power-law data into data points and propose an average strategy for least-squares to fit power-law distributions. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that our proposed method fits power-law data perfectly. We uncover a fundamental flaw in the popular method proposed by Clauset et al. [12]: it tends to discard the majority of power-law data and fit the long-tailed noises.

Here, we integrated the available genomic and transcriptomic data of G. uralensis and constructed the G. uralensis gene co-expression network.

Furthermore, gene families of G. uralensis were predicted by tools including iTAK (Plant Transcription factor and Protein kinase Identifier and Classifier), HMMER (hidden Markov models), InParanoid, and PfamScan. Finally, we constructed a platform for gene function analysis in G. uralensis (GURFAP, www.gzybioinfoormatics.cn/GURFAP). For analyzed and predicted gene function, we introduced various tools including BLAST (Basic local alignment search tool), GSEA (Gene set enrichment analysis), Motif, Heatmap, and JBrowse.

We also took CYP88D6, CYP72A154, and bAS gene in the synthesis pathway of glycyrrhizin as examples to demonstrate the reliability and availability of our platform.

Ever since the disease came to worldwide attention, numerous models with varying levels of sophistication have been proposed; many of these have tried to predict the course of the disease over different time-scales, ranging from attempting to project the number of active cases over successive days and weeks, to attempts at forecasting the date(s) on which subsequent ``waves \u2019\u2019 of the pandemic will purportedly emerge. Other models have examined the efficacy of the various policy measures that have been adopted (including the unparalleled use of ``lockdowns \u2019\u2019 , i.e., extremely stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces) by countries around the world in an attempt to contain and combat the disease. This multiplicity of models may have given the impression of an apparent over-abundance of distinct mathematical approaches to investigate how pandemics evolve over time. More importantly, some of the more extravagant claims made by a few modeling groups about their ability to predict future outcomes, that went hand in hand with the occasional abuse of models by agencies having vested interests, have led to bewilderment in many quarters about the true capabilities and utility of mathematical modeling. Here we provide a brief guide to the epidemiological modeling enterprise, focusing on how it has emerged as a tool for informed public-health policy-making and has in turn, influenced the design of interventions aimed at preventing disease outbreaks from turning into raging epidemics. We show that the diversity of models is somewhat illusory, as the bulk of them are rooted in the compartmental modeling framework that we describe here. While its basic structure may appear to be a highly idealized description of the processes at work, we show that features that provide more realism, such as the community organization of populations or strategic decision-making by individuals, can be incorporated in such models to make them behave in accordance with empirical observations. We conclude with the argument that the true value of models lies in their ability to test in silico the consequences of different policy choices in the course of an epidemic, a much superior alternative to trial-and-error approaches that are highly costly in terms of both lives and socio-economic disruption.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 84, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2022-03-23", "authors": [{"authorId": "145016786", "name": "S.

Co-methylation between DNAm sites is a known phenomenon but the full architecture of relationships between the approximately 450,000 (450k) sites most commonly measured in epidemiological studies has not been described. We investigate whether the cis and trans interindividual co-methylation structure amongst the 450k sites changes across the lifecourse, whether it differs between UK-born White and Pakistani individuals, and how it may be related to genome regulation. Results We find stability across the life course (birth to adolescence), across cohorts, and between two ethnic groups. Highly correlated DNAm sites in close proximity are highly heritable, influenced by nearby genetic variants (cis mQTLs), and are enriched for transcription factor (TF) binding sites related to regulation of short RNAs essential for cellular function transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Highly correlated sites that are either distant, or on different chromosomes, are driven by both common and unique environmental factors, and methylation at these sites is less likely to be driven by genotype. They are enriched for a multitude of TF binding sites and for inter-chromosomal chromatin contact sites, suggesting that DNA co-methylation of distant sites may be related to long-range cooperative TF interactions. Conclusions We conclude that DNA co-methylation, especially in cis, has a stable structure from birth to adolescence and between white British and Pakistani individuals.

While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale\u2010invariance.

Through highlighting the advantages and challenges of the technique, the article provides insight into how to best conduct fMRI fractal analysis and properly interpret the findings with physiological relevance.

In this work, we focus on parallelising the state-of-the-art simple cycle enumeration algorithms by Johnson and Read-Tarjan along with their applications to temporal graphs. To our knowledge, we are the first ones to parallelise these two algorithms in a fine-grained manner. We are also the first to demonstrate experimentally a linear performance scaling. Such a scaling is made possible by our decomposition of long sequential searches into fine-grained tasks, which are then dynamically scheduled across CPU cores, enabling an optimal load balancing. Furthermore, we show that coarse-grained parallel versions of the Johnson and the Read-Tarjan algorithms that exploit edge- or vertex-level parallelism are not scalable. On a cluster of four multi-core CPUs with 256 physical cores, our fine-grained parallel algorithms are, on average, an order of magnitude faster than their coarse-grained parallel counterparts.

We propose four complexity dimensions for the network representation and five generations of models for the dynamics modelling to describe the increasing complexity level of the CNS that will be developed towards achieving DT (e.g. CNS dynamics modelled offline in the 1st generation v.s. CNS dynamics modelled simultaneously with a two-way real time feedback between reality and the CNS in the 5th generation). Based on that, we propose a new framework to conceptually compare diverse existing modelling paradigms from different perspectives and create unified assessment criteria to evaluate their respective capabilities of reaching such an ultimate goal. Using the proposed criteria, we also appraise how far the reviewed current state-of-the-art approaches are from the idealised DTs.

The islet of Langerhans is a biological system with relatively simple architecture that affords the opportunity for high-fidelity experimental and computation analysis, making it an ideal system to answer biological network theory-based questions. Here, we analyze both experimental and computational models of the islet to quantify the relationship between the gap junction structural network and functional synchronization networks.

To better understand the probability mechanisms driving biological complexity and the pathological role of extreme values, we propose that the observed skewed discrete distributions are generated by non-linear transition rates of birth and death processes (BDPs). We introduce a (3d+1)-parameter Generalized Gaussian Hypergeometric Probability ((3d+1)-GHP) model with the probabilities defined by a stationary solution of generalized BDP (g-BDP) and represented by generalized hypergeometric series with regularly varying function properties. We study the Regularly Varying 3d-Parameter Generalized Gaussian Hypergeometric Probability (3d-RGHP) function\u2019s regular variation properties, asymptotically constant slow varying component, unimodality and upward/ downward convexity which allows us to specify a family of 3d-RGHP models and study their analytical and numerical characteristics.

The results show that the parameterized model not only fits the \u2018heavy tail\u2019 well, but also the entire EFD taken on the complete experimental outcome space.

Therefore, we analyzed gene expression profiles of non-metastatic kidney cancer to find mechanisms associated with the early-stage pathogenesis of the disease. We concentrated on the most dysregulated genes in expression to discover possible unknown proliferative molecular mechanisms and oncogenic pathways promoting kidney renal cancer growth. Survival analysis, expression profiling, and gene set over-representation analysis were conducted on the most upregulated and most down-regulated genes alongside the hub genes. Our results demonstrated that pathways engaged in the metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates and those involved in peroxisome organization were shown to be important in developing benign tumors. Furthermore, upregulation of genes such as CXCL9 and 10 genes and CXCR4 in chemokine response pathways would bolster differentiation and engagement of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. C3, one of the essential members of the complement system, with a high degree and betweenness centrality in the PPI network, upregulated significantly not only in our analysis but also in the validation expression profiling results and survival analysis. We also identified genes such as TYROBP, ITGB2, and EGFR to be engaged in both immunological pathways and superoxide pathways. Furthermore, we found that downregulation of Aldolase B engaged in Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis pathways would help develop benign tumors. Finally, many top hub genes, including TYMS, PTPRC, AURKA, FN1, UBE2C, and CD53 were proposed to be engaged in the progression of non-metastatic renal tumors.

To construct such a representative set of graphs, we propose a new random graph generator, Random Plots, in which we (1) generate a diversified set of vertex degree distributions and (2) target a graph generator at each of the constructed distributions, one-by-one, to obtain the ensemble of graphs. To assess the diversity of the resulting ensembles, we (1) substantialize the vague notion of diversity in a graph ensemble as the diversity of the numeral characteristics of the graphs within this ensemble and (2) compare such formalized diversity for the proposed model with that of three other common models (Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi\u2013Gilbert (ERG), scale-free, and small-world).

In this paper, we study the effects of adding an (cid:96) 2 penalty of the embedding vectors to the training loss of these types of methods. We prove that, under some exchangeability assumptions on the graph, this asymptotically leads to learning a graphon with a nuclear-norm-type penalty, and give guarantees for the asymptotic distribution of the learned embedding vectors. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of subsampling method used as part of stochastic gradient descent.

Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected.

These assumptions are consistent with empirical data, with keyword research practices, and with approximate algorithms used to take counts of query frequencies. A few estimators of the parameters of the distribution are devised and experimented, based on the nature of the empirical/simulated data. For continuous data, we recommend using nonlinear least square regression (NLS) on the top-volume queries, where the bound on the volume is obtained from the well-known Clauset, Shalizi and Newman (CSN) estimation of power-law parameters. For binned data, we propose using a Chi-square minimization approach restricted to the top-volume queries, where the bound is obtained by the binned version of the CSN method. Estimations are then derived for the total number of queries and for the total volume of the population, including statistical error bounds. We apply the methods on the domain of recipes and cooking queries searched in Italian in 2017.

Because organisms are also flexible enough to evolve, they arguably operate in a critical dynamical regime between order and chaos. The established theory of criticality is based on networks of interacting automata where Boolean truth values model presence/absence of biochemical molecules. The dynamical regime is predicted using network connectivity and node bias (to be on/off) as tuning parameters. Revising this to account for canalization leads to a significant improvement in dynamical regime prediction. The revision is based on effective connectivity, a measure of dynamical redundancy that buffers automata response to some inputs. In both random and experimentally validated systems biology networks, reducing effective connectivity makes living systems operate in stable or critical regimes even though the structure of their biochemical interaction networks predicts them to be chaotic. This suggests that dynamical redundancy may be naturally selected to maintain living systems near critical dynamics, providing both robustness and evolvability.

In such communities, participation is highly unequal: few people concentrate the majority of the workload, while the rest provide irregular and sporadic contributions. The distribution of participation is typically characterized as a power law distribution. However, recent statistical studies on empirical data have challenged the power law dominance in other domains. This work critically examines the assumption that the distribution of participation in wikis follows such distribution. We use statistical tools to analyse over 6,000 wikis from Wikia/Fandom, the largest wiki repository. We study the empirical distribution of each wiki comparing it with different well-known skewed distributions. The results show that the power law performs poorly, surpassed by three others with a more moderated heavy-tail behavior. In particular, the truncated power law is superior to all competing distributions, or superior to some and as good as the rest, in 99.3% of the cases. These findings have implications that can inform a better modeling of participation in peer production, and help to produce more accurate predictions of the tail behavior, which represents the activity and frequency of the core contributors. Thus, we propose to consider the truncated power law as the distribution to characterize participation distribution in wiki communities.

In sharp contrast to classical literature on noiseless U-statistics, we showed that the Edgeworth expansion of a network moment statistic as a noisy U-statistic can achieve higher-order accuracy without non-lattice or smoothness assumptions but just requiring weak regularity conditions. Behind this result is our surprising discovery that the two typically-hated factors in network analysis, namely, sparsity and edge-wise observational errors, jointly play a blessing role, contributing a crucial self-smoothing effect in the network moment statistic and making it analytically tractable. Our assumptions match the minimum requirements in related literature. \nFor practitioners, our empirical Edgeworth expansion is highly accurate and computationally efficient. It is also easy to implement. These were demonstrated by comprehensive simulation studies. \nWe showcase three applications of our results in network inference.

Recently, Broido and Clauset [A.D. Broido, A. Clauset, Nature Communication, 10, 1017 (2019)] asserted that the degree distributions of real-world networks are rarely power law under statistical tests. Such complex networks, including social, biological, information, temporal, and brain networks, are often heavy-tailed where the assumption on the scale-free nature of real-world heavy-tailed networks become insignificant as the complex system evolves over time. The failure of power law distribution in fitting the degree distribution data is mainly due to the presence of an identifiable non-linearity within the entire degree distribution in a log-log scale of a complex heavy-tailed network. In this study, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a new class of heavy-tailed probability distributions for modeling the entire degree distributions of complex networks. We introduce a new family of generalized Lomax models (GLM) to capture the non-linearity of these heavy-tailed networks. These newly introduced GLM-type distributions provide better fitting and greater flexibility to the entire node degree distribution of complex networks. Several statistical properties of the proposed model, such as extreme value and inferential statistical properties, are derived into this context. Interestingly, the GLM family belongs to the basin of attraction of Frechet distribution, a heavy-tailed extreme value distribution. Rigorous experimental analysis showcases the excellent performance of the proposed family of distributions while fitting the heavy-tailed real-world complex networks over fifty real-world datasets in comparison with benchmark probability models.

GGMs identify conditional dependence by estimating a precision matrix between genes or proteins. However, conventional GGM approaches often ignore prior knowledge about protein-protein interactions (PPI). Recently, several groups have extended GGM to weighted graphical Lasso (wGlasso) and network-based gene set analysis (Netgsa) and have demonstrated the advantages of incorporating PPI information. However, these methods are either computationally intractable for large-scale data, or disregard weights in the PPI networks. To address these shortcomings, we extended the Netgsa approach and developed an augmented high-dimensional graphical Lasso (AhGlasso) method to incorporate edge weights in known PPI with omics data for global network learning. This new method outperforms weighted graphical Lasso-based algorithms with respect to computational time in simulated large-scale data settings while achieving better or comparable prediction accuracy of node connections. The total runtime of AhGlasso is approximately five times faster than weighted Glasso methods when the graph size ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 with a fixed sample size (n = 300).

At first sight, perhaps not much. They involve totally different agents and scale levels of observation. On second thought, however, perhaps they share everything. A growing body of literature suggests that living systems at different scale levels of observation follow the same architectural principles and process information in similar ways. Moreover, such systems appear to respond in similar ways to rising levels of stress, especially when stress levels approach near-lethal levels. To explain such communalities, we argue that all organisms (including humans) can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian controls systems that are governed by the same biophysical principles. Such systems show generic changes when taxed beyond their ability to correct for environmental disturbances. Without exception, stressed organisms show rising levels of \u2018disorder\u2019 (randomness, unpredictability) in internal message passing and overt behavior. We argue that such changes can be explained by a collapse of allostatic (high-level integrative) control, which normally synchronizes activity of the various components of a living system to produce order. The selective overload and cascading failure of highly connected (hub) nodes flattens hierarchical control, producing maladaptive behavior. Thus, we present a theory according to which organic concepts such as stress, a loss of control, disorder, disease, and death can be operationalized in biophysical terms that apply to all scale levels of organization. Given the presumed universality of this mechanism, \u2018losing control\u2019 appears to involve the same process anywhere, whether involving bacteria succumbing to an antibiotic agent, people suffering from physical or mental disorders, or social systems slipping into warfare. On a practical note, measures of disorder may serve as early warning signs of system failure even when catastrophic failure is still some distance away.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 178, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/12/1701/pdf?version=1640074991", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-12-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "4846895", "name": "R.

To support the extraction of biological knowledge, individual gene expression levels are transformed to Gene Co-expression Networks (GCNs). In a GCN, nodes correspond to genes, and the weight of the connection between two nodes is a measure of similarity in the expression behavior of the two genes. In general, GCN construction and analysis includes three steps; 1) calculating a similarity value for each pair of genes 2) using these similarity values to construct a fully connected weighted network 3) finding clusters of genes in the network, commonly called modules. The specific implementation of these three steps can significantly impact the final output and the downstream biological analysis. GCN construction is a well-studied topic. Existing algorithms rely on relatively simple statistical and mathematical tools to implement these steps. Currently, software package WGCNA appears to be the most widely accepted standard. We hypothesize that the raw features provided by sequencing data can be leveraged to extract modules of higher quality. A novel preprocessing step of the gene expression data set is introduced that in effect calibrates the expression levels of individual genes, before computing pairwise similarities. Further, the similarity is computed as an inner-product of positive vectors.

Limited diagnostic methods hampered the infection control. Since the direct detection of virus mainly by RT-PCR may cause false-negative outcome, host response-dependent testing may serve as a complementary approach for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. Objective Our study discovered a highly-preserved transcriptional profile of Type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent genes for COVID-19 complementary diagnosis. Methods Computational language R-dependent machine learning was adopted for mining highly-conserved transcriptional profile (RNA-sequencing) across heterogeneous samples infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. The transcriptomics/high-throughput sequencing data were retrieved from NCBI-GEO datasets (GSE32155, GSE147507, GSE150316, GSE162835, GSE163151, GSE171668, GSE182569). Mathematical approaches for homological analysis were as follows: adjusted rand index-related similarity analysis, geometric and multi-dimensional data interpretation, UpsetR, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Besides, Interferome Database was used for predicting the transcriptional factors possessing IFN-I promoter-binding sites to the key IFN-I genes for COVID-19 diagnosis. Results In this study, we identified a highly-preserved gene module between SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal swab and postmortem lung tissue regulating IFN-I signaling for COVID-19 complementary diagnosis, in which the following 14 IFN-I-stimulated genes are highly-conserved, including BST2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, ISG15, MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL, RSAD2, and STAT1. The stratified severity of COVID-19 may also be identified by the transcriptional level of these 14 IFN-I genes. Conclusion Using transcriptional and computational analysis on RNA-seq data retrieved from NCBI-GEO, we identified a highly-preserved 14-gene transcriptional profile regulating IFN-I signaling in nasal swab and postmortem lung tissue infected by SARS-CoV-2.

One view says that we can only claim to fully understand a network if we have the ability to influence or control it and predict the results of the employed control mechanisms. The area of control and controllability has progressed notably in the past ten years with several frameworks proposed namely, structural, exact, and physical. With continuing advancement in the area, the need to develop effective and efficient control methods that provide robust control is increasingly critical. The ultimate responsibility for controlling the network lies with the set of driver nodes that, according to the classical definition of the control theory of complex systems, can steer the network from any given state to a desired final state. To be able to develop better control mechanisms, we need to understand the relationship between different network structures and the number of driver nodes needed to control a given structure. This will allow understanding of which networks might be easier to control and the resources needed to control them. In this paper, we present a systematic study that builds an understanding of how network profiles (random (R), small-world (SW), scale-free (SF)) influence the number of driver nodes needed for control. Additionally, we also consider real social networks and identify their driver nodes set to further expand the discussion.

This lack of dependence on region size leads us to hypothesize that virus spread depends on universal properties of the network of social interactions. We test this hypothesis by simulating the propagation of a virus on networks of different topologies. Our main finding is that Gompertz growth observed for early outbreaks occurs only for a scale-free network, in which nodes with many more neighbors than average are common. These nodes that have very many neighbors are infected early in the outbreak and then spread the infection very rapidly. When these nodes are no longer infectious, the remaining nodes that have most neighbors take over and continue to spread the infection. In this way, the rate of spread is fastest at the very start and slows down immediately. Geometrically it is seen that the \u201csurface\u201d of the epidemic, the number of susceptible nodes in contact with the infected nodes, starts to rapidly decrease very early in the epidemic and as soon as the larger nodes have been infected. In our simulation, the speed and impact of an outbreak depend on three parameters: the average number of contacts each node makes, the probability of being infected by a neighbor, and the probability of recovery.

Both methods show high agreement with each other and also with the available biomedical literature available on this neurodegenerative disease. On the basis of their p\u2013value, 20 significantly upregulated and 19 significantly downregulated genes were found to be playing role in the manifestation of motor and non motor symptoms of the disease, as interpreted from the enrichment analysis. Gene expression dataset of Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) used in this study was obtained from the GeneExpression Omnibus namely GSE8397, GSE20164, and GSE20295 (Edgar, 2002). Among the important genes extracted, the top downregulated and upregulated genes were studied using enrichment analysis. Out of the 19 common downregulated genes, 10 were directly associated with neuron development and differentiation. Two of the genes, FGF13 and CDC42 were associated with multiple signalling pathways. The gene NSF was found to be enriched with GABAergic synapse, associated with the predominating inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. The inhibitory synapses are thought to provide a brake to neural firing. The upregulated genes DDIT4, HSPB1, NUPR1, GPNMB and CH13L1 were enriched with apoptotic signalling pathway while MT1M, MT1E, MT1F, MT1X were associated with mineral absorption pathways.

Encoding simulation experiments for the networks of Open Graph Benchmark demonstrated BIND and BYMOND can successfully hide random messages in the edge lists.

To improve graph update efficiency, we first characterize the performance trade-offs of input-oblivious batch reordering. Guided by our findings, we propose input-aware batch reordering to adaptively reorder input batches based on their degree distributions. To complement adaptive batch reordering, we propose updating graphs dynamically, based on their input characteristics, either in software (via update search coalescing) or in hardware (via acceleration support). To improve graph computation efficiency, we present input-aware work aggregation which adaptively modulates the computation granularity based on inter-batch locality characteristics. Evaluated across 260 workloads, our input-aware techniques provide on average 4.55 \u00d7 and 2.6 \u00d7 improvement in graph update performance for different input types (on top of eliminating the performance degradation from input-oblivious batch reordering).

In particular, the structure of gene-gene expression correlation contains information on the underlying gene regulatory networks. However, interpretation of scRNA-seq data is challenging due to specific experimental error and biases that are unique to this kind of data including drop-out (or technical zeros). Methods To deal with this problem several methods for imputation of zeros for scRNA-seq have been developed. However, it is not clear how these processing steps affect inference of genetic networks from single cell data. Here, we introduce Biomodelling.jl, a tool for generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data using multiscale modelling of stochastic gene regulatory networks in growing and dividing cells. Results Our tool produces realistic transcription data with a known ground truth network topology that can be used to benchmark different approaches for gene regulatory network inference. Using this tool we investigate the impact of different imputation methods on the performance of several network inference algorithms.

This paper makes a first step in this direction by analyzing the influence that social networks and the state of a public good or common property resource have on compliance with social norms. The analysis signposts the maximal and minimal influence different types of social networks have for supporting a stable steady-state with full cooperation, thereby allowing policymakers to compare the effectiveness of legal (e.g., fines or subsidies) and informal (e.g., network-oriented) enforcement policies. The study also shows that social networks allow reducing the stringency of enforcement policies. Yet, cooperation is unlikely to prevail if the agents do not perceive the social dilemma as severe. We find that stable steady states where compliers and defectors coexist (partial cooperation) are supported and their stability depends on the type of functions representing social pressure and sanctioning costs. The analytical framework is employed for an empirical study of an aquifer in Spain. It reveals that subsidizing the compliers\u2019 costs of social pressure may impede a stable steady state based on partial cooperation with a large area of attraction.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 93, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-10-11", "authors": [{"authorId": "117375677", "name": "Jorge Marco"}, {"authorId": "144936167", "name": "R.

Such data may contain noise that contribute to false positive edges, which motivates the use of edge-wise thresholding. Thresholding procedures are useful for reducing network density in graphs to retain only the most informative, non-noisy edges. Nevertheless, limited consensus exists on selecting appropriate threshold levels. We compare existing thresholding methods and introduce a novel thresholding approach in the context of MRI-derived and simulated brain connectomes. Performance is measured using normalized mutual information (NMI), a quantity robust to arbitrary changes in partition labeling, and describes the similarity of community structure between two node-matched networks. We found that the percolation-based threshold and our newly proposed \u201cobjective function\u201d-based threshold exhibited the best performance in terms of NMI. We show an application of these two thresholding methods to real data that showed that both percolation-based and objective function-based thresholding provide statistically similar NMI values between real world FC networks and structural connectivity (SC) counterparts, where shared modular structure is assumed. The two thresholding methods, however, achieve these NMI values at significantly different thresholds (p<0.0001) in both simulated and real networks.

The gravity model is a widely-used approach for estimating and predicting population flows in urban mobility networks. Prior studies have reported very good performance results for the gravity model as they tested it using origin-destination (O-D) data at certain levels of aggregation. Also, the main premise of the gravity model in urban networks is the existence of the scale-free property. The characteristics of urban mobility networks, such as scale-free properties, network size, the existence of hubs and giant components, however, might vary depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions of data based on which these networks are constructed. Hence, the sensitivity of gravity model performance to variation in the level of aggregation of data and the temporal and spatial scale of urban mobility networks needs to be examined. To address this gap, this study examined the basic gravity model, which captures the flow magnitude between O-D pairs based on three variables (population of the origin, population of the destination, and the distance between them). Accordingly, we constructed the urban mobility networks using fine-grained location-based human mobility data for multiple US metropolitan counties. The constructed urban mobility networks have finer resolution as they capture population flow among census tracts on an hourly and daily scale (as opposed to previous studies which used larger spatial blocks). The results show that the scale-free property does not always exist when urban mobility networks are constructed from data with finer spatial and temporal resolution. By examining the association between macroscopic network characteristics, such as the number of nodes and links, average degree, average clustering coefficient, assortativity coefficient, and predictive performance, we found weak association between performance and certain network structures. The findings suggest that: (1) finerscale urban mobility networks do not demonstrate a scale-free property; (2) the performance of the basic gravity model decays for predicting population flow in the finer-scale urban mobility networks; (3) the variations in population density distribution and mobility network structure and properties across counties do not significantly influence the performance of gravity models. Hence, gravity models may not be suitable for modeling urban mobility networks with daily or hourly aggregation of census tract to census tract movements. The findings highlight the need for new-generation urban mobility network models or machine learning approaches to better predict fine-scale and high temporal-resolution urban mobility networks. ___________________________ Zachry Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, 3136 TAMU Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-3136 Corresponding author: Chia Wei Hsu, Zachry Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University, 3136 TAMU, College Station, Texas Email: chawei0207@tamu.edu", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 6, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-09-08", "authors": [{"authorId": "46652745", "name": "Chia-Hung Hsu"}, {"authorId": "1490931604", "name": "Chao Fan"}, {"authorId": "48813438", "name": "A.

The voters reach these decisions based on a myopic assessment of their local network, which they take as a proxy for the entire electorate: voters know which candidate their neighbors prefer and they assume-perhaps incorrectly-that those neighbors will turn out to vote, so they themselves cast a vote if and only if it would produce a tie or a win for their preferred candidate in their local neighborhood.

Robustness, a system's stability, and resilience, the ability to return to a stable state, are key concepts that span multiple disciplines within and outside the biological sciences. Discovering and applying common rules that govern the robustness and resilience of biological systems is a critical step toward creating solutions for species survival in the face of climate change, as well as the for the ever-increasing need for food, health, and energy for human populations. We propose that network theory provides a framework for universal scalable mathematical models to describe robustness and resilience and the relationship between them, and hypothesize that resilience at lower organization levels contribute to robust systems. Insightful models of biological systems can be generated by quantifying the mechanisms of redundancy, diversity, and connectivity of networks, from biochemical processes to ecosystems. These models provide pathways towards understanding how evolvability can both contribute to and result from robustness and resilience under dynamic conditions. We now have an abundance of data from model and non-model systems and the technological and computational advances for studying complex systems. Several conceptual and policy advances will allow the research community to elucidate the rules of robustness and resilience. Conceptually, a common language and data structure that can be applied across levels of biological organization needs to be developed. Policy advances such as cross-disciplinary funding mechanisms, access to affordable computational capacity, and the integration of network theory and computer science within the standard biological science curriculum will provide the needed research environments.

The hierarchical graph model quantifies the length distribution of shortest paths in large-scale graphs, provides appropriate fence values for every SSSP computation.

Computational modeling, as an essential research method, has generated promising testable quantitative models that represent complex interplay among different gene regulatory mechanisms based on these data in many biological systems. However, given the dynamic changes of interactome in chaotic systems such as cancers, and the dramatic growth of heterogeneous data on this topic, such promise has encountered unprecedented challenges in terms of model complexity and scalability. In this study, we introduce a new integrative machine learning approach that can infer multifaceted gene regulations in cancers with a particular focus on microRNA regulation. In addition to new strategies for data integration and graphical model fusion, a supervised deep learning model was integrated to identify conditional microRNA-mRNA interactions across different cancer stages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn a case study of human breast cancer, we have identified distinct gene regulatory networks associated with four progressive stages. The subsequent functional analysis focusing on microRNA-mediated dysregulation across stages has revealed significant changes in major cancer hallmarks, as well as novel pathological signaling and metabolic processes, which shed light on microRNAs' regulatory roles in breast cancer progression.

Conventional graph traversal methods, such as push and pull, traverse all vertices in the same manner, and we show applying a uniform traversal direction for all edges leads to sub-optimal memory locality, hence poor efficiency. This paper argues that different vertices in power-law graphs have different locality characteristics and the traversal method should be adapted to these characteristics. To solve this problem, we propose to inspect the number of destination and source vertices in selecting a cache-compatible traversal direction for each type of vertex. We introduce in-Hub Temporal Locality (iHTL), a structure-aware SpMV that combines push and pull in one graph traversal, but for different vertex types. iHTL exploits temporal locality by traversing incoming edges to in-hubs in push direction, while processing other edges in pull direction. The evaluation shows iHTL is 1.5 \u00d7 - 2.4 \u00d7 faster than pull and 4.8 \u00d7 - 9.5 \u00d7 faster than push in state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks such as GraphGrind, GraphIt and Galois.

Fitting a degree distribution to network data is challenging, in particular, for scale-free networks with power-law degrees.

By solving an optimization problem, we provide tight (the sharpest possible) bounds for the subgraph counts, for all possible subgraphs, and for all networks with degree distributions that share the same mean and MAD. We identify the extremal random graph that attains these tight bounds as the graph with a specific three-point degree distribution. We leverage the bounds on the maximal subgraph counts to obtain robust scaling laws for how the number of subgraphs grows as a function of the network size.

We describe a general framework for simulating node and edge generation processes in such networks, including a procedure for simulating case subjects, and experiment with four methods of modelling subject relevance: using subject similarity as linear features, as fitness coefficients, constraining the citable graph by subject, and computing subject-sensitive PageRank scores. Model properties are studied by simulation and compared against existing baselines. Promising approaches are then benchmarked against empirical networks from the United States and Singapore Supreme Courts. Our models better approximate the structural properties of both benchmarks, particularly in terms of subject structure. We show that differences in the approach for modelling subject relevance, as well as for normalizing attachment probabilities, produce significantly different network structures. Overall, using subject similarities as fitness coefficients in a sum-normalized attachment model provides the best approximation to both benchmarks.

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public\u2019s reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases.

We propose a generic framework in this paper that leverages parallel computing without re-engineering the original methods. The proposed framework uses state-of-the-art methods as a black box to infer sub-networks of the segmented data matrix. A simple merger was designed based on preferential attachment to generate the global network by merging the sub-networks. Fifteen (15) inference methods were considered for experimentation. Qualitative and speedup analysis was carried out using DREAM challenge networks. The proposed framework was implemented on all the 15 inference methods using large expression matrices. The results were auspicious as we could infer large networks in reasonable time without compromising the qualitative aspects of the original (serial) algorithm.

To address this issue, we characterized the TeraTox test, a newly developed multi-lineage differentiation assay for human teratogenicity prediction using 3D human induced pluripotent stem cells. TeraTox produces as primary output concentration-dependent data sets for each test compound on cytotoxicity and altered gene expression. These data are then fed into a prediction model based on an interpretable machine-learning approach. The final information obtained relates to the concentration-dependent human teratogenicity potential of drug candidates. We applied TeraTox to profile 33 approved pharmaceuticals and 12 proprietary drug candidates with known in vivo data. This way, it was possible to relate the test predictions to known human or animal toxicity. The TeraTox had an accuracy of 69% (specificity: 53%, sensitivity: 79%). It clearly performed better than two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and it had a higher sensitivity than the murine embryonic stem cell test (mEST) run in the same laboratory. By combining TeraTox and mEST data, the overall prediction accuracy was further improved. The knowledge on the pattern of altered gene expression may provide additional value in grouping toxicologically similar compounds and possibly deducing common modes of action.

Marine feed ingredients must be replaced to meet global demand, with challenges for fish health and sustainability. Metabolic models can address this by connecting genomes to metabolism, which converts nutrients in the feed to energy and biomass, but such models are currently not available for major aquaculture species such as salmon. We present SALARECON, a model focusing on energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism that links the Atlantic salmon genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. It performs well in standardized tests and captures expected metabolic (in)capabilities. We show that it can explain observed hypoxic growth in terms of metabolic fluxes and apply it to aquaculture by simulating growth with commercial feed ingredients. Predicted limiting amino acids and feed efficiencies agree with data, and the model suggests that marine feed efficiency can be achieved by supplementing a few amino acids to plant- and insect-based feeds. SALARECON is a high-quality model that makes it possible to simulate Atlantic salmon metabolism and growth. It can be used to explain Atlantic salmon physiology and address key challenges in aquaculture such as development of sustainable feeds. Author summary Atlantic salmon aquaculture generates billions of euros annually, but faces challenges of sustainability. Salmon are carnivores by nature, and fish oil and fish meal have become scarce resources in fish feed production. Novel, sustainable feedstuffs are being trialed hand in hand with studies of the genetics of growth and feed efficiency. This calls for a mathematical-biological framework to integrate data with understanding of the effects of novel feeds on salmon physiology and its interplay with genetics. We have developed the SALARECON model of the core salmon metabolic reaction network, linking its genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. Computational analyses show good agreement with observed growth, amino acid limitations, and feed efficiencies, illustrating the potential for in silico studies of potential feed mixtures. In particular, in silico screening of possible diets will enable more efficient animal experiments with improved knowledge gain.

Here we deploy large-scale numerical simulations to quantify the impact on pathogen transmission of a set of topological features covering the parameter space of realistic possibility. We first test through a series of stochastic simulations the differences in the spread of disease on several classes of network geometry (including highly skewed networks and small world).

For this, we build a dataset composed of more than 9000 social networks and 30 topological network metrics.

Leveraging two-year historical port call data (covering 6,000 records in total) of Indonesian domestic cargo vessels from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), this study examines the spatiotemporal changes of maritime freight transport network connectivity and cargo shipping capacity throughout the COVID-19 outbreaks period. We constructed two directed graphs, one in 2019 and another in the 2020 period, based on 1,283 Indonesian domestic cargo ship trajectories that connect 25 main Indonesian ports through 370 links. This study calculated and compared the four metrics of complex network analysis, including assortative coefficient, average degree, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, to figure out the shipping network pattern changes. The result shows that the network connectivity and its shipping capacity changed in 2020, although the national port call trend is not significantly different from 2019. Based on our observation, we notice that the network is shifting from a \"main hub-and-spoke connection,\" which dominantly involves western Indonesia hub-ports structure, towards a \"multi hub-and-spoke connection,\" which increases the ports centrality position in eastern Indonesia. We also analyzed the change of cargo shipping capacity in each link to reflect how shipping liner companies respond to the pandemics.

This compartmental modelling approach, however, delivers an incomplete picture of the dynamics of epidemics, as it neglects stochastic and network effects, and the role of the measurement process, on which the estimation of epidemiological parameters and incidence values relies. In order to study the related issues, we combine established epidemiological spreading models with a measurement model of the testing process, considering the problems of false positives and false negatives as well as biased sampling. Studying a model-generated ground truth in conjunction with simulated observation processes (virtual measurements) allows one to gain insights into the fundamental limitations of purely data-driven methods when assessing the epidemic situation. We conclude that epidemic monitoring, simulation, and forecasting are wicked problems, as applying a conventional data-driven approach to a complex system with nonlinear dynamics, network effects and uncertainty can be misleading. Nevertheless, some of the errors can be corrected for, using scientific knowledge of the spreading dynamics and the measurement process.

The software provides a framework to study molecular mechanisms of gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions underlying quantitative trait\u2019s realization and allows detailed mechanistic studies of impact of genetic and phenotypic variance on gene regulation. MeSCoT performs a detailed simulation of genes\u2019 regulatory interactions for variable genomic architectures and generates complete set of transcriptional and translational data together with simulated quantitative trait values.

The various methods aimed at generalising the classical approaches applied to static networks are constantly being improved. In this paper, we describe a framework that extend to stream graphs iterative weighted-rich-clubs characterisation for static networks proposed in [1]. The general principle is that we no longer consider the membership of a node to one of the weighted-rich-clubs for the whole time period, but each node is associated with a temporal profile which is the concatenation of the successive memberships of the node to the weighted-rich-clubs that appear, disappear and change all along the period. A clustering of these profiles gives the possibility to establish a reduced list of typical temporal profiles and so a more in-depth understanding of the temporal structure of the network.

In the literature, this phenomenon is expressed as opinion formation and has a wide range of applications, including predicting social movements, predicting political voting results, and marketing. The interactions could be face-to-face or via online social networks. The social opinion phases are categorized into consensus, majority, and non-majority. In this research, we study phase transitions due to interactions between connected people with various noise levels using agent-based modeling and a computational social science approach. Two essential factors affect opinion formations: the opinion formation model and the network topology. We assumed the social impact model of opinion formation, a discrete binary opinion model, appropriate for both face-to-face and online interactions for opinion formation. For the network topology, scale-free networks have been widely used in many studies to model real social networks, while recent studies have revealed that most social networks fit log-normal distributions, which we considered in this study. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to consider the log-normal distribution network topology in phase transitions in the social impact model of opinion formation. The results reveal that two parameters affect the phase transition: noise level and segregation. A non-majority phase happens in equilibrium in high enough noise level, regardless of the network topology, and a majority phase happens in equilibrium in lower noise levels. However, the segregation, which depends on the network topology, affects opinion groups\u2019 population. A comparison with the scale-free network topology shows that in the scale-free network, which have a more segregated topology, resistance of segregated opinion groups against opinion change causes a slightly different phase transition at low noise levels.

Due to the recent explosion of heterogeneous multimodal data sources generated in the biomedical domain, and an industry shift toward a systems biology approach, knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. Areas covered In this review, the author summarizes the applications of knowledge graphs in drug discovery. They evaluate their utility; differentiating between academic exercises in graph theory, and useful tools to derive novel insights, highlighting target identification and drug repurposing as two areas showing particular promise. They provide a case study on COVID-19, summarizing the research that used knowledge graphs to identify repurposable drug candidates. They describe the dangers of degree and literature bias, and discuss mitigation strategies. Expert opinion Whilst knowledge graphs and graph-based machine learning have certainly shown promise, they remain relatively immature technologies. Many popular link prediction algorithms fail to address strong biases in biomedical data, and only highlight biological associations, failing to model causal relationships in complex dynamic biological systems. These problems need to be addressed before knowledge graphs reach their true potential in drug discovery.", "venue": "Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 122, "citationCount": 12, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-12", "authors": [{"authorId": "1729298968", "name": "Finlay MacLean"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "e8a372d2e5f080144ae684e297396aa4ca0eeb01", "corpusId": 39320494, "title": "Social network formation and strategic interaction in large networks", "abstract": null, "venue": "Mathematical Social Sciences", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-04-09", "authors": [{"authorId": "2421443", "name": "Euncheol Shin"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "f0110c3f93bb511f3dc767cdba3139b6f29b84f4", "corpusId": 230579218, "title": "Scale-free networks, 1/f dynamics, and nonlinear conflict size scaling from an agent-based simulation model of societal-scale bilateral conflict and cooperation", "abstract": null, "venue": "Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0378437120309766", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2021-04-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "46932614", "name": "S.

In addition, the papers\u2019 citation count is related to the process by which the knowledge about this paper propagates in the scientific community. Our measurements indicate that the fitness distribution for different disciplines is nearly identical and can be approximated by the log-normal distribution, while the viral propagation process is discipline specific. The model explains which sets of citation distributions can be scaled and which cannot.

The dynamical state of criticality is achieved by striking a balance such that activity can effectively spread through the network without overwhelming it and is commonly identified in neuronal networks by observing the behavior of cascades of network activity termed \u201cneuronal avalanches.\u201d The dynamic activity that occurs in neuronal networks is closely intertwined with how the elements of the network are connected and how they influence each other's functional activity. In this review, we highlight how studying criticality with a broad perspective that integrates concepts from physics, experimental and theoretical neuroscience, and computer science can provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms that drive networks to criticality and how their disruption may manifest in different disorders. First, integrating graph theory into experimental studies on criticality, as is becoming more common in theoretical and modeling studies, would provide insight into the kinds of network structures that support criticality in networks of biological neurons. Furthermore, plasticity mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping these neural structures, both in terms of homeostatic maintenance and learning. Both network structures and plasticity have been studied fairly extensively in theoretical models, but much work remains to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental findings. Finally, information theoretical approaches can tie in more concrete evidence of a network's computational capabilities. Approaching neural dynamics with all these facets in mind has the potential to provide a greater understanding of what goes wrong in neural disorders.

However, they usually assume very small, regular networks, with strong constraints on the strength of selection considered.

This paper aims to introduce the most frequently used centrality measures, but more importantly to point out the problems related to their application and to sketch potential solutions for these problems. First, three basic centrality measures are introduced: degree, betweenness, and closeness. There are three broad categories of issues with centrality measures. These categories are: inadequate operationalisation of centrality measures, explanation of their distribution, and interdependence of observation in statistical modelling. A typology of flows in the network is presented as a potential solution allowing for transparent operationalisation. The so-called positional approach is another potential solution allowing for conceptually and computationally rigorous definition of centrality measures. Lastly, statistical models for network data are introduced as a way to deal with interdependence of observations.

Players are cooperators if they correctly declare their value added tax (VAT), and are defectors otherwise. Each player's payoff is influenced by the amount evaded and the subjective probability of being inspected by tax authorities. Since transactions between companies must be declared by both the buyer and seller, a strategy adopted by one influences the other?s payoff. We study the model with a wellmixed population and different scalefree networks. Model parameters were calibrated using real-world data of VAT declarations by businesses registered in the Canary Islands region of Spain. We analyzed several scenarios of audit probabilities for high and low transactions and their prevalence in the population, as well as social rewards and penalties to find the most efficient policy to increase the proportion of cooperators. Two major insights were found. First, increasing the subjective audit probability for low transactions is more efficient than increasing this probability for high transactions. Second, favoring social rewards for cooperators or alternative penalties for defectors can be effective policies, but their success depends on the distribution of the audit probability for low and high transactions.", "venue": "IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 4, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://accedacris.ulpgc.es/jspui/bitstream/10553/107085/1/09400530.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2021-01-12", "authors": [{"authorId": "144278344", "name": "M.

For instance, classical Boltzmann statistics together with the corresponding partition function have been used to apply the tools of statistical physics to the analysis of variations in network structure. However, the physical analogy adopted in this analysis, together with the interpretation of the resulting system of particles is sometimes vague and remains an open question. This, in turn, has implications concerning the definition of quantities such as temperature and energy. In this paper, we take a novel view of the thermal characterisation where we regard the edges in a network as the particles of the thermal system. By considering networks with a fixed number of nodes we obtain a conservation law which applies to the particle occupation configuration. Using this interpretation, we provide a physical meaning for the temperature which is related to the number of network nodes and edges. This provides a fundamental description of a network as a thermal system. If we further interpret the elements of the adjacency matrix as the binary microstates associated with edges, this allows us to further extend the analysis to systems with edge-weights. We thus introduce the concept of the canonical ensemble into the thermal network description and the corresponding partition function and then use this to compute the thermodynamic quantities.

Omics methods can identify a large number of putative network components (on the order of hundreds or thousands) but it is possible that in many cases a small subset of genes control the state of GRNs. Here, we explore how the topology of the interactions between network components may indicate whether the effective state of a GRN can be represented by a small subset of genes. We use methods from information theory to model the regulatory interactions in GRNs as cascading and superposing information channels. We propose an information loss function that enables identification of the conditions by which a small set of genes can represent the state of all the other genes in the network. This information-theoretic analysis extends to a measure of free energy change due to communication within the network, which provides a new perspective on the reducibility of GRNs. Both the information loss and relative free energy depend on the density of interactions and edge communication error in a network.

But it is evident from a closer observation that there exists a clearly identifiable non-linear pattern in the entire degree distribution in a log-log scale. Thus, the classical power-law distribution is often inadequate to fit the large-scale complex network data sets. The presence of this non-linearity can also be linked to the recent debate on scarcity versus the universality of scale-free networks. The search, therefore, continues to develop probabilistic models that can efficiently capture the crucial aspect of heavy-tailed and long-tailed behavior of the entire degree distribution of real-world complex networks. This paper proposes a new variant of the popular Lomax distribution, termed as modified Lomax (MLM) distribution, which can efficiently fit the entire degree distribution of real-world networks. The newly introduced MLM distribution arises from a hierarchical family of Lomax distributions and belongs to the basin of attraction of Frechet distribution. Some interesting statistical properties of MLM including characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimates have been studied.

The intrinsic unequal relationships of such kind, however, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems. For instance, when a node in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its neighboring nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them can be vastly diverse. Even if such potentially heterogeneous interactions epitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a result of the aforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance or dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible. In this work, we precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the framework to discover hidden dependent relations extracted from weighted networks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic criterion to select the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the concept of information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the effective number of neighbors or the effective out-degree to each node, and the resultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden dependent relations by leaving only the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology to two time-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations between nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the historical record of Korea, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD).

The analysis reveals that ragas Harikaambhoji, Kharaharapriya, Shankarabharanam, Mayamalavagaula and Natabhairavi emerges as the hubs of the network illustrating the influence of these ragas in the evolution of Karnatik music.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2190145693", "name": "Vinuraj Devaraj"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "6cfd7673bb41bd091d754648a4e7d05dee99cb61", "corpusId": 253111612, "title": "ICT in Business and the Public Sector", "abstract": "We use company transaction data to empirically describe the effects of Covid-19 on the Dutch economy. By using transaction data, we distinguish ourselves from previous work: the transaction data spanning the years 2019 and 2020 provides the unique opportunity to empirically show the actual effect of Covid-19, without making estimations. In particular, we compare a network from the data during the intelligent lockdown period, with a network from the data over the same period in 2019. We compare these networks based on their structure, specifically by analyzing the strength distributions. Furthermore, we compute the random-walk centrality of industries, to detect the industries that are most immediately impacted by a shock. Next, we describe the change of consumer spending behavior in the intelligent lockdown period. We then analyze how the full inter-industry network was affected by this change, both directly and indirectly, using the maximum flow metric. The findings show that even though the economy was impacted during the intelligent lockdown, the structure of the network remained quite the same. Industries with high randomwalk centrality are mostly industries that offer general services to a wide range of other industries, such as investment or administration services. Further patterns are hard to distill because during the intelligent lockdown, a variety of macroeconomic factors either positively or negatively influence industries in the network. By analyzing consumption, we focused on one of these factors. We find a decline in card payments here, which are in some cases substituted by the cashless payments channel. The change in consumer spending behavior affects the majority of industries negatively. Especially industries in the food and accommodation, and cultural sector, were directly impacted by a decline in consumer spendings. If there are positive effects, these tend to be bigger. Examples of industries that directly profit from the lockdown are supermarkets and webshops.

One of the most persistent challenges in genome biology has been confidently reconstructing radiations of complex gene families. Olfactory receptors (ORs) represent just such a gene family with upward of thousands of receptors in some mammalian taxa. Whereas in birds olfaction was historically an overlooked sensory modality, new studies have revealed an important role for smell. Chromosome-level assemblies for birds allow a new opportunity to characterize patterns of OR diversity among major bird lineages. Previous studies of short-read\u2013based (second-generation) genome assemblies have associated OR gene family size with avian ecology, but such conclusions could be premature especially when new assembly methods reshape our understanding of avian OR evolution. Here we provide a fundamental characterization of OR repertoires in five recent genome assemblies, including the most recent assembly of golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). We find that short read-based assemblies systematically undercount the avian-specific gamma-c OR subfamily, a subfamily that comprises over 65% of avian OR diversity. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies, we find a high diversity of gamma-c ORs across the avian tree of life. Building on these findings, ongoing sequencing efforts and improved genome assemblies will clarify the relationship between OR diversity and avian ecology.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 230, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "40380214", "name": "R.

Researchers have proposed a new and promising defense to counter LFAs, referred to as topology deception. This strategy centers on hindering the discovery of bottlenecks by presenting false trace responses to adversaries as they perform topological probing of the target network. Even though the goal of topology deception centers on obscuring critical links, node dependencies can be exploited by an adversary. However, current approaches do not consider a wide range of metrics that may reveal important and diverse aspects of network bottlenecks. Furthermore, existing approaches create a simple form of virtual topology, which is subject to relatively easy detection by the adversary, reducing its effectiveness.

In order to understand the changes in residue-residue contacts induced upon ligand-binding in proteins, we performed topological analyses of three CAR systems and four RNR systems under different binding conditions. Four measures of centrality were used to evaluate structural changes between ligand-free and ligand-bound systems: betweenness, closeness, degree, and eigenvector centralities. Although ligand-binding induced contact rearrangements resulting in substantial changes in centrality values for many residues, the distributions of centrality values were generally very similar for all systems. Results obtained here suggested that closeness centrality primarily identifies residues that are physically central to the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Previous reports suggested that closeness centrality identifies important residues in enzyme active sites. However, this may only be true for enzymes whose active site is centrally located. Moreover, the distributions for degree centrality are not powerlaw distributed, which also raises the question of whether the power-law degree distribution should be assumed for all \u201dreal-world\u201d networks.

Initial investigations with two different representative topographies (\u201cscale-free-like\u201d and \u201crich club-like\u201d) produce interesting results when brought to a CVM free energy minimum. Additional phase space investigations, where one of these two parameters has been set to zero, identify useful parameter ranges. Careful comparison of the analytically-predicted configuration variables versus those obtained when performing computational free energy minimization on a 2-D grid show that the computational results differ significantly from the analytic solution. The 2-D CVM can potentially function as a secondary free energy minimization within the hidden layer of a neural network, providing a basis for extending node activations over time and allowing temporal correlation of patterns.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/319/pdf?version=1616398275", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2023221", "name": "A.

Forty-one elderly cognitively healthy controls and 30 aMCI subjects were included. We constructed functional connectivity matrices among brain voxels and examined nodal degree distributions that were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation. In the whole-brain networks and all functional subnetworks, the connectivity degree distributions were fitted better by the Weibull distribution [f(x)~x(\u03b2\u22121)e(\u2212\u03bbx\u03b2)] than power law or power law with exponential cutoff.

These networks provide the cells with mechanical support, and allow cells to change their shape, migrate, divide and develop a mechanical communication with their environment. The quick adaptation of these networks upon stretch or compression is important for cell survival in real situations. Using atomic force microscopy to poke living cells with sharp tips, we revealed that they respond to a local and quick shear through a cascade of random and abrupt ruptures of their cytoskeleton, suggesting that they behave as a quasi-rigid random network of intertwined filaments. Surprisingly, the distribution of the strength and the size of these rupture events did not follow power-law statistics but log-normal statistics, suggesting that the mechanics of living cells would not fit into self-organized critical systems. We propose a random Gilbert network to model a cell cytoskeleton, identifying the network nodes as the actin filaments, and its links as the actin cross-linkers. We study mainly two versions of avalanches. First, we do not include the fractional visco-elasticity of living cells, assuming that the ruptures are instantaneous, and we observe three avalanche regimes, 1) a regime where avalanches are rapidly interrupted, and their size follows a distribution decaying faster than a power-law; 2) an explosive regime with avalanches of large size where the whole network is damaged and 3) an intermediate regime where the avalanche distribution goes from a power-law, at the critical point, to a distribution containing both 1) and (ii). Then, we introduce a time varying breaking probability, to include the fractional visco-elasticity of living cells, and recover an approximated log-normal distribution of avalanche sizes, similar to those observed in experiments. Our simulations show that the log-normal statistics requires two simple ingredients: a random network without characteristic length scale, and a breaking rule capturing the broadly observed visco-elasticity of living cells.

This has important implications on the dynamic origins of network self-organization and consequently, on the general interpretation of their function and resilience. However, a well-known mechanism of departure from scale invariance is the presence of finite size effects. Developed for critical phenomena, finite size scaling analysis assesses whether an underlying scale invariance is clouded by a sample limited in size. Our approach sorts out when we may reject the hypothesis that the inherent structure of networks is scale invariant. We analyze about 200 naturally occurring networks with distinct dynamical origins to formally test whether the commonly assumed hypothesis of an underlying scale-free structure is generally viable. This has recently been questioned on the basis of statistical testing of the validity of power law distributions of network degrees. Specifically, we analyze by finite size scaling analysis the datasets of real networks to check whether the purported departures from power law behavior are due to the finiteness of sample size. We find that a large number of the networks follows a finite size scaling hypothesis without any self-tuning. This is the case of biological protein interaction networks, technological computer and hyperlink networks, and informational networks in general. Marked deviations appear in other cases, especially involving infrastructure and transportation but also in social networks.

Leveraging topological properties of the network, along with characteristics of the hazard field, may be an expedient way of predicting network robustness compared to more computationally-intensive simulation methods. Prior work has shown that the topological properties are insightful for predicting robustness, considered here to be measured by the relative size of the largest connected subgraph after failures, especially for networks experiencing random failures. While this does not equate to full engineering-based performance, it does provide an indication of the robustness of the network. In this work, we consider the effect that spatially-correlated failures have on network robustness using only spatial properties of the hazard and topological properties of networks. The results show that the spatial properties of the hazard together with the mean nodal degree, mean clustering coefficient, clustering coefficient standard deviation and path length standard deviation are the most influential factors in characterizing the network robustness.

As of May 27, 2020, CORD-19 includes more than 100,000 open access publications from major publishers and PubMed as well as preprint articles deposited into medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arXiv. Recent years, however, have also seen question-answering and other machine learning systems exhibit harmful behaviors to humans due to biases in the training data. It is imperative and only ethical for modern scientists to be vigilant in inspecting and be prepared to mitigate the potential biases when working with any datasets. This article describes a framework to examine biases in scientific document collections like CORD-19 by comparing their properties with those derived from the citation behaviors of the entire scientific community. In total, three expanded sets are created for the analyses: 1) the enclosure set CORD-19E composed of CORD-19 articles and their references and citations, mirroring the methodology used in the renowned \u201cA Century of Physics\u201d analysis; 2) the full closure graph CORD-19C that recursively includes references starting with CORD-19; and 3) the inflection closure CORD-19I, that is, a much smaller subset of CORD-19C but already appropriate for statistical analysis based on the theory of the scale-free nature of the citation network. Taken together, all these expanded datasets show much smoother trends when used to analyze global COVID-19 research. The results suggest that while CORD-19 exhibits a strong tilt toward recent and topically focused articles, the knowledge being explored to attack the pandemic encompasses a much longer time span and is very interdisciplinary. A question-answering system with such expanded scope of knowledge may perform better in understanding the literature and answering related questions.

Results To address these challenges, we developed SCNIC: Sparse Cooccurrence Network Investigation for compositional data. SCNIC is open-source software that can generate correlation networks and detect and summarize modules of highly correlated features. Modules can be formed using either the Louvain Modularity Maximization (LMM) algorithm or a Shared Minimum Distance algorithm (SMD) that we newly describe here and relate to LMM using simulated data. We applied SCNIC to two published datasets and we achieved increased statistical power and identified microbes that not only differed across groups, but also correlated strongly with each other, suggesting shared environmental drivers or cooperative relationships among them. Conclusions SCNIC provides an easy way to generate correlation networks, identify modules of correlated features and summarize them for downstream statistical analysis. Although SCNIC was designed considering properties of microbiome data, such as compositionality and sparsity, it can be applied to a variety of data types including metabolomics data and used to integrate multiple data types. SCNIC allows for the identification of functional microbial relationships at scale while increasing statistical power through feature reduction.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/16/2020.11.13.380733.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-11-16", "authors": [{"authorId": "49576568", "name": "M.

Accordingly, almost all researchers authored some scientific articles. Scholarly publications represent at least two benefits for the study of the scientific community as a social group. First, they attest of some form of relation between scientists (collaborations, mentoring, heritage,...), useful to determine and analyze social subgroups. Second, most of them are recorded in large data bases, easily accessible and including a lot of pertinent information, easing the quantitative and qualitative study of the scientific community. Understanding the underlying dynamics driving the creation of knowledge in general, and of scientific publication in particular, in addition to its interest from the social science point of view, can contribute to maintaining a high level of research, by identifying good and bad practices in science. In this manuscript, we attempt to advance this understanding by a statistical analysis of publications within peer-reviewed journals.

In complex systems, the cooperative dynamics is largely determined by the network structure which dictates the interactions among neighboring individuals. Despite an abundance of studies, the role of the network structure in in promoting cooperation through generalized reciprocity remains an under-explored phenomenon. In this doctoral thesis, we utilize basic tools from the dynamical systems theory, and develop a unifying framework for investigating the cooperation dynamics of generalized reciprocity on complex networks. We use this framework to present a theoretical overview on the role of generalized reciprocity in promoting cooperation in three distinct interaction structures: i) social dilemmas, ii) multidimensional networks, and iii) fluctuating environments. The results suggest that cooperation through generalized reciprocity always emerges as the unique attractor in which the overall level of cooperation is maximized, while simultaneously exploitation of the participating individuals is prevented. The effect of the network structure is captured by a local centrality measure which uniquely quantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by dictating the degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and macroscopic level. As a consequence, the implementation of our results may go beyond explaining the evolution of cooperation. In particular, they can be directly applied in domains that deal with the development of artificial systems able to adequately mimic reality, such as reinforcement learning.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 111, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2020-10-30", "authors": [{"authorId": "8638776", "name": "Viktor Stojkoski"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "2fefb5d46c10f9bcc7a155390917af991624f0d1", "corpusId": 225103501, "title": "Exploring complex networks with the ICON R package", "abstract": "We introduce ICON, an R package that contains 1075 complex network datasets in a standard edgelist format.

The present work aims to situate the intermittency of dexterous behavior explicitly in multifractal modeling for non-Gaussian cascade processes. Multiscale probability density function (PDF) analysis of the center of pressure (CoP) fluctuations during quiet upright standing yields non-Gaussianity parameters lambda exhibiting task-sensitive curvilinear relationships with timescale. The present reanalysis aims for a finer-grained accounting of how non-Gaussian cascade processes might align with known, separable postural processes. It uses parallel decomposition of non-Gaussianity lambda-vs.-timescale and CoP. Orthogonal polynomials decompose lambda curvilinearity, and rambling-trembling analysis decomposes CoP into relatively more intentional rambling (displacement to new equilibrium points) and less intentional trembling sway (deviations around new equilibrium points). Modeling orthogonal polynomials of non-Gaussianity\u2019s lambda-vs.-timescale relationship allows us to differentiate linear from quadratic decay, each of which indicates scale-invariant and scale-dependent cascades, respectively. We tested whether scale-dependent and scale-invariant cascades serve different roles, that is, responding to destabilizing task demands and supporting the proactive movement to a new equilibrium point, respectively. We also tested whether these cascades appear more clearly in rambling rather than trembling sway. More generally, we test whether multifractal nonlinear correlations supports this capacity of postural control to this two-step differentiation: both into rambling vs. trembling, then into scale-dependent vs. scale-invariant cascades within rambling sway. The results supported these hypotheses. Thus, the present work aligns specific aspects of task setting with aspects of cascade dynamics and confirms multifractal foundations of the organism-task relationship.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 85, "citationCount": 8, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-10-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "1399320366", "name": "Damian G.

The prediction accuracy of these estimation methods is highly dependent on the covariance structure, which is characterized by gene regulation networks. However, the manner in which the structure of a gene regulation network together with the sample size affects prediction accuracy has not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the prediction accuracy for several network structures under various sample sizes. Results When the gene regulation network was random graph, the simulation indicated that models with high estimation accuracy could be achieved with small sample sizes. However, a real gene regulation network is likely to exhibit a scale-free structure. In such cases, the simulation indicated that a relatively large number of observations is required to accurately predict traits from a transcriptome.

This study applies agent-based modeling (ABM) to information-seeking behavior. The primary focus is the role of network structure in shaping the spread of information. The present study confirms and extends existing diffusion research by showing that in-degree hierarchy influences multiple diffusion outcomes; hierarchy determines the likely targets of information requests, but its effects are contingent on structural fluidity, the extent that information-seekers may deviate from typical network behavior. Consistent with prior research, more rigid hierarchies increase the potential for rapid diffusion but dramatically increase the risk of diffusion failure. However, the effects of hierarchy that enable rapid diffusion do not require extreme rigidity, but rather are enhanced by a moderately fluid network in which information requests deviate to an extent from the structurally defined channels. This study also analyzes the effects of initial conditions, and the distribution of information itself within networks.

We focus on testing whether the tail of the empirical degrees behaves like the tail of a de Solla Price model, a two-parameter power-law distribution. We modify the well-known Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test to achieve even sensitivity along the tail, considering the dependence between the empirical degrees under the null distribution, while guaranteeing sufficient power of the test. We apply the method to many empirical degree distributions.

The strength of the relationships between sequentially ordered elements of language (e.g., phonemes, characters, words) decays following a power law as a function of sequential distance. To understand the origins of these relationships, we examined long-range statistical structure in the speech of human children at multiple developmental time points, along with non-linguistic behaviors in humans and phylogenetically distant species. Here we show that adult-like power-law statistical dependencies precede the production of hierarchically-organized linguistic structures, and thus cannot be driven solely by these structures. Moreover, we show that similar long-range relationships occur in diverse non-linguistic behaviors across species. We propose that the hierarchical organization of human language evolved to exploit pre-existing long-range structure present in much larger classes of non-linguistic behavior, and that the cognitive capacity to model long-range hierarchical relationships preceded language evolution. We call this the Statistical Scaffolding Hypothesis for language evolution. 1 Significance Statement Human language is uniquely characterized by semantically meaningful hierarchical organization, conveying information over long timescales. At the same time, many non-linguistic human and animal behaviors are also often characterized by richly hierarchical organization. Here, we compare the long-timescale statistical dependencies present in language to those present in non-linguistic human and animal behaviors as well as language production throughout childhood. We find adult-like, long-timescale relationships early in language development, before syntax or complex semantics emerge, and we find similar relationships in non-linguistic behaviors like cooking and even housefly movement.

Although it is well known how each individual physiological system functions, there is little research focused on how the integration and adjustment of multiple systems results in the generation of metabolic health. The aim here was to generate an integrative model of metabolism, seen as a physiological network, and study how it changes across the human lifespan. We used data from a transverse, community-based study of an ethnically and educationally diverse sample of 2572 adults. Each participant answered an extensive questionnaire and underwent anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist), fasting blood tests (glucose, HbA1c, basal insulin, cholesterol HDL, LDL, triglycerides, uric acid, urea, and creatinine), along with vital signs (axillar temperature, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure). The sample was divided into 6 groups of increasing age, beginning with less than 25 years and increasing by decades up to more than 65 years. In order to model metabolic homeostasis as a network, we used these 15 physiological variables as nodes and modeled the links between them, either as a continuous association of those variables, or as a dichotomic association of their corresponding pathological states. Weight and overweight emerged as the most influential nodes in both types of networks, while high betweenness parameters, such as triglycerides, uric acid and insulin, were shown to act as gatekeepers between the affected physiological systems. As age increases, the loss of metabolic homeostasis is revealed by changes in the network\u2019s topology that reflect changes in the system\u2212wide interactions that, in turn, expose underlying health stages. Hence, specific structural properties of the network, such as weighted transitivity, i.e., the density of triangles in the network, can provide topological indicators of health that assess the whole state of the system.

These three strategies are applied to attack a number of strong scale-free networks of various sizes generated from the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model and the uncorrelated configuration model. It is found that both DALR and DILR are more effective than RLR in the sense that rewiring a smaller number of links can succeed in the same attack.

The concerted activity of microbial community in mangrove sediment mediates element cycling, but the underpinning mechanism of microbial synergy remains unknown. ResultsHere, we reconstructed 671 strain-resolved metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from three mangrove and two mudflat sediments in Mai Po Nature Reserve. We then inferred the genome-scale co-occurrence and co-transcription networks based on metabolic capacity and transcriptional activity of the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. We observed that the centrality was significantly higher in co-transcription networks than in co-occurrence networks, indicating that MAGs had stronger interrelationships when transcriptionally active. Further, we classified 57 microbes with low relative abundance (0.01\u20130.79%) as keystone taxa, which play key roles in the maintenance of co-transcription network structure, and participate in carbon transformations, denitrification, and sulfate reduction processes. One of the keystone taxa is a newly proposed deltaproteobacterial order, Candidatus Mangrovidesulfobacterales, capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and an anaerobic mixotrophic lifestyle. These findings highlight the ecological importance of rare species.

On the other hand, it has become evident that regional infection curves of COVID-19 exhibit complex patterns which often differ from curves predicted by forecasting models. The wide variations in attack rate observed among different social strata suggest that this may be due to social heterogeneity not accounted for by regional models. We investigated this hypothesis by developing and using a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model that focuses on subpopulations that are vulnerable in the sense of having an increased likelihood of spreading infection among themselves. We found that the isolation or embedding of vulnerable sub-clusters in a major population hub generated complex stochastic infection patterns which included multiple peaks and growth periods, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second wave of infection. Embedded vulnerable groups became hotspots that drove infection despite efforts of the main population to socially distance, while isolated groups suffered delayed but intense infection. Amplification of infection by these hotspots facilitated transmission from one urban area to another, causing the epidemic to hopscotch in a stochastic manner to places it would not otherwise reach; whereas vaccination only in hotspot populations stopped geographic spread of infection. Our results suggest that social heterogeneity is a key factor in the formation of complex infection propagation patterns.

Since logic is a powerful tool to model problems, it has been used to obtain very general meta-theorems. In this work, we consider all problems definable in first-order logic and analyze which properties of complex networks allow them to be solved efficiently. \nThe mathematical tool to describe complex networks are random graph models. We define a property of random graph models called $\\alpha$-power-law-boundedness. Roughly speaking, a random graph is $\\alpha$-power-law-bounded if it does not admit strong clustering and its degree sequence is bounded by a power-law distribution with exponent at least $\\alpha$ (i.e. the fraction of vertices with degree $k$ is roughly $O(k^{-\\alpha})$). \nWe solve the first-order model-checking problem (parameterized by the length of the formula) in almost linear FPT time on random graph models satisfying this property with $\\alpha \\ge 3$.

In this paper we address this gap and investigate two forms of availability that are a necessary ingredient to achieve such reliability. We first study the Lightning network's ability to route payments of various sizes to nearly every participating node, over most available channels. We establish an inverse relationship between payment volume and success rate and show that at best only about a third of destination nodes can be successfully reached. The routing is hampered by a number of possible errors, both transient and permanent. We then study the availability of nodes in the network longitudinally and determine how long-lived they are. Churn in the network is actually low, and a considerable number of nodes are hosted on cloud providers. By testing node liveness, we find that the propagated network information is relatively often stale, however, both for IP addresses and Tor onion addresses.

Dynamic transcriptome analysis holds great potential to uncover coordinated biological processes between organs. However, many existing dynamic transcriptome studies are characterized by sparse and often unevenly spaced time points that make the identification of causal relationships across organs analytically challenging. Application of existing statistical models, designed for regular time series with abundant time points, to sparse data may fail to reveal biologically significant, causal relationships. With increasing research interest in biological time series data, there is a need for new statistical methods that are able to determine causality within and between time series data sets. Here, a statistical framework was developed to identify (Granger) causal gene-gene relationships of unevenly spaced, multivariate time series data from two different tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to a nitrogen signal. Results This work delivers a statistical approach for modelling irregularly sampled bivariate signals which embeds functions from the domain of engineering that allow to adapt the model\u2019s dependence structure to the specific sampling time. Using Maximum-Likelihood to estimate the parameters of this model for each bivariate time series, it is then possible to use bootstrap procedures for small samples (or asymptotics for large samples) in order to test for Granger-Causality. When applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana data, the proposed approach produced 3,078 significant interactions, in which 2,012 interactions have root causal genes and 1,066 interactions have shoot causal genes. Many of the predicted causal and target genes are known players in local and long-distance nitrogen signaling, including genes encoding transcription factors, hormones, and signaling peptides. Of the 1,007 total causal genes (either organ), 384 are either known or predicted mobile transcripts, suggesting that the identified causal genes may be directly involved in long-distance nitrogen signaling through intercellular interactions. The model predictions and subsequent network analysis identified nitrogen-responsive genes that can be further tested for their specific roles in long-distance nitrogen signaling.

Here, we define a fundamental property\u2014the degree\u2013degree distance\u2014possessed by each link, the distribution of which usually exhibits a stronger power law than the degree distribution of a finite-size network as indicated by empirical and statistical studies. A bidirectional preferential selection model is introduced to explain and reproduce this finding, which implies that being scale free as a property should not be defined by apparent statistics but determined by the underlying mechanism. We conclude that power-law degree\u2013degree distance distribution better represents the scale-free property. Whether real-world complex networks are scale free or not has long been controversial. Recently, in Broido and Clauset [A. D. Broido, A. Clauset, Nat. Commun. 10, 1017 (2019)], it was claimed that the degree distributions of real-world networks are rarely power law under statistical tests. Here, we attempt to address this issue by defining a fundamental property possessed by each link, the degree\u2013degree distance, the distribution of which also shows signs of being power law by our empirical study. Surprisingly, although full-range statistical tests show that degree distributions are not often power law in real-world networks, we find that in more than half of the cases the degree\u2013degree distance distributions can still be described by power laws. To explain these findings, we introduce a bidirectional preferential selection model where the link configuration is a randomly weighted, two-way selection process. The model does not always produce solid power-law distributions but predicts that the degree\u2013degree distance distribution exhibits stronger power-law behavior than the degree distribution of a finite-size network, especially when the network is dense. We test the strength of our model and its predictive power by examining how real-world networks evolve into an overly dense stage and how the corresponding distributions change. We propose that being scale free is a property of a complex network that should be determined by its underlying mechanism (e.g., preferential attachment) rather than by apparent distribution statistics of finite size.

The increasing popularity and advancement of social net- works paired with the availability of social network data enable empirical analysis, inference, prediction and modelling of social patterns. This data-driven approach towards social science is continuously evolving and is crucial for modelling and understanding of human social behaviour including predicting future social interactions for a wide range of applications. The main difference between traditional datasets and network datasets is the presence of the relational components (links) between instances (nodes) of the network. These links and nodes induce intricate local and global patterns, defining the topology of a network. The topology is ever evolving, determining the dynamics of such a networked system. The work presented in this thesis starts with an extensive analysis of three standard network models, in terms of their properties and self-interactions as well as the size and density of the resultant graphs. These crucial analysis and understanding of the main network models are utilised to later develop a comprehensive network simulation framework. A set of novel nature-inspired link prediction approaches are then developed to predict the evolution of networks, based solely on their topologies. Building on top of these approaches, enhanced topological representations of networks are subsequently combined with node characteristics for the purpose of node classification. Finally, the proposed classification methods are extensively evaluated using simulated networks from our network simulation framework as well as two real-world citation networks. The link prediction approaches proposed in this research show that the topology of the network can be further exploited to improve the prediction of future relationships.

In this paper, we propose a new class of heavy-tailed probability distributions, which we call \u201cgeneralized Lomax model\u201d. In the generalized Lomax model, we model the tail-index or the shape parameter of the Lomax distribution using a nonlinear function, which depends on the data and two parameters. This new class of distributions will be useful for modeling heavy-tailed network data sets in the whole range. The basic structural properties of the proposed model, including its extreme value and inferential properties, are presented. The newly derived generalized Lomax models belong to the maximum domain of attractions of the Frechet distribution and are right tail equivalent to Pareto distribution. The closeness of the generalized Lomax models with that of various life distributions is investigated. Experimental analysis suggests that the proposed distributions can better model large-scale, heavy-tailed network data sets in the whole range compared to current state-of-the-art models.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-07", "authors": [{"authorId": "46204267", "name": "T.

Our work bridges this divide by testing whether two influential social mechanisms used to explain community joining can also explain the distribution of community sizes. Using agent-based simulations, we evaluate how well individual-level processes of social exposure and decisions based on individual expected benefits reproduce empirical community size data from Reddit. Our simulations contribute to social computing theory by providing evidence that both processes together---but neither alone---generate realistic distributions of community sizes.

Questions abound: How do we feed a growing population? What steps must we take to conserve ecologically valuable ecosystems? How can we create the greatest improvements in global food security and equality? The increasing impacts of climate change on Earth\u2019s systems only serve to heighten the importance of, and difficulty in, answering these questions. Given the complexity of the systems \u2013 trade networks, ecosystems, etc. \u2013 to which these questions pertain, it is crucial that we gain a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics before taking action. Without this, any changes to these complex human-environment systems could have unintended and potentially calamitous effects. As such, the value of modelling techniques for exploring the dynamics and potential futures of these complex systems is high. This thesis uses models to examine the behaviour and possible future trajectories of 3 such systems. We begin by delving into the temporal evolution of the global wheat trade network using a dynamic network model. A preferential attachment mechanism is found to provide a good fit to the empirical network, based on several key metrics. Our modelled trade network is quite fragile to shocks. However, as it grows towards 2050, its resilience to attacks will increase. Next, we implement a spatially-explicit agent-based model for the forest-grassland mosaics of Southern Brazil. These ecologically valuable systems are fragile, with simulated mosaics persisting only over a narrow range of conditions. Mosaics may cease to exist in scenarios where climate change impacts greatly reduce fire-mediated recruitment thresholds. When climate change effects are less severe mosaics that do not disappear exhibit substantial alterations to their spatial structure. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a human metapopulation linked through a trade network. Centrality to the network is key to obtaining high food per capita, and differences in centrality may result in inequalities between patches. Inequalities and issues of food security can also arise when patch-level behaviours differ. Larger and more regular network structures facilitate more equal patch-level outcomes and higher levels of food security. However, when patch-level import behaviours are heterogeneous, the best course of action is to first modify these behaviours before adjusting the network topology. Across all 3 projects, modelled systems display complex behaviours. This emphasizes the necessity of further development of models for complex human-environment systems that can provide a more complete understanding of system dynamics and potential futures. The insights gained from these models can be used to inform policies for facilitating positive outcomes in real-world complex systems.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 347, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Geography"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Geography", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-06-01", "authors": [{"authorId": "22256856", "name": "K.

However, most of the available results focus on static networks, challenging our mathematical understanding of coordination in temporal networks. In this article, we study discrete-time stochastic consensus over temporal networks, modeled as activity-driven networks. In this paradigm, each node has a specific tendency to create links in the network, measured through an activity potential. Differences in the activity potential of nodes favor the evolution of heterogeneous networks, in which some nodes are more involved in the process of information sharing than others. Through stochastic stability theory, we characterize the expected consensus state, which is found to be dominated by low-activity nodes. By further leveraging eigenvalue perturbation techniques, we derive a closed-form expression for the convergence rate in a mean-square sense, which points at a detrimental effect of moderate levels of heterogeneity for large networks.

This intermittency can be understood in various ways. First, variability can be intermittent through the engagement and disengagement of complementary control processes at distinct scales. A second and perhaps a deeper way to understand this intermittency is through the possibility that closed-loop control depends on the cascade-like interactions across many timescales at once. These diverse control processes suggest specific non-Gaussian distributional properties at different timescales. Multiscale probability density (PDF) analysis shows that quiet standing on a stable surface exhibits a crossover between low non-Gaussianity (consistent with exponential distributions) at shorter timescales reflecting openloop control, increasing towards higher non-Gaussianity and subsequently decreasing (consistent with cascade-driven L\u00e9vy-like distributions) at longer scales. Destabilizing quiet standing elicits non-Gaussianity that begins high and decreases across timescales (consistent with cascade-driven L\u00e9vy-like distribution), reflecting closed-loop postural corrections at more of the shorter timescales. Finally, indices of postural sway govern the appearance or disappearance of crossovers, suggesting that tempering of non-Gaussianity across log-timescale in stable-surface condition is mostly a function of endogenous postural control. These results provide new evidence that cascading interactions across longer-timescales supporting postural corrections can even recruit shorter-timescale processes with novel task constraints.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 102, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/06/2020.05.19.104760.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Physics", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-05-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "6964222", "name": "M.

The urban dynamic models developed by the so-called \u201curban science\u201d can provide a useful foundation for more sustainable urban policies. It implies that their proposals have been validated by correct observations of the diversity of situations in the world. However, international comparisons of the evolution of cities often produce unclear results because national territorial frameworks are not always in strict correspondence with the dynamics of urban systems. We propose to provide various compositions of systems of cities in order to better take into account the dynamic networking of cities that go beyond regional and national territorial boundaries. Different models conceived for explaining city size and urban growth distributions enable the establishing of a correspondence between urban trajectories when observed at the level of cities and systems of cities. We test the validity and representativeness of several dynamic models of complex urban systems and their variations across regions of the world, at the macroscopic scale of systems of cities. The originality of the approach resides in the way it considers spatial interaction and evolutionary path dependence as major features in the general behavior of urban entities. The models studied include diverse and complementary processes, such as economic exchanges, diffusion of innovations, and physical network flows. Complex systems dynamics is in principle unpredictable, but contextualizing it regarding demographic, income, and resource components may help in minimizing the forecasting errors. We use, among others, a new unique source correlating population and built-up footprint at world scale: the Global Human Settlement built-up areas (GHS-BU). Following the methodology and results already obtained in the European GeoDiverCity project, including USA, Europe, and BRICS countries, we complete them with this new dataset at world scale and different models.

Young-adult 6 beagles and senior 6 beagles were anesthetized with sevoflurane 2.0%-5.0% and three of 64 sec EEG (256 Hz) from Fpz-T4 via scalp electrodes were recorded. Three thresholds for peak-to-peak voltage were set: mean value of peak-to-peak voltage at sevoflurane 2.0% in each dog (AS2%), 3mcrV, and 5mcrV. The subthreshold periods were discriminated as $\\tau$ events. We fitted the empirical probability distribution of $\\tau$ by a power-law distribution and an exponential distribution. These two distributions were compared by the normalized log-likelihood ratio test to see which distribution was better fit. At sevoflurane 2.0%-3.0%, by any threshold, the exponential distribution became better fit in all dogs. The power-law distribution became better fit only when BS expressed on EEG. No strict threshold was required for detection of onset of BS.

This paper focuses on overcoming the computational challenge through data reduction that intelligently takes advantage of the heavy-tailed distributional property of most flow datasets.

We test this approach with representative algorithms from three common method families, namely flowAMOEBA from flow clustering, Louvain from network community detection, and PageRank from network centrality algorithms. A variety of flow datasets are adopted for the experiments, including inter-city travel flows, cellphone call flows, and synthetic flows. We propose a standard evaluation framework to evaluate the applicability of not only the selected three algorithms, but any given method in a systematic way. The results prove that head/tail breaks can significantly improve the computational capability and efficiency of flow data analyses while preserving result quality, on condition that the analysis emphasizes the \u201chead\u201d part of the dataset or the flows with high absolute values.

Results indicated that 6-gingerol inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in these 3 cell lines. Moreover, 6-gingerol was shown to increase the mRNA expression of the caspase family thereby suggesting that 6-gingerol induced apoptosis through the caspase-dependent pathway. To explore the signaling pathway regulating 6-gingerol induced apoptosis, we utilized and integrated the network pharmacology approach together with experimental investigations. Targets of 6-gingerol were identified from ChEMBL and STITCH databases, which were used for constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results from the PPI network indicated that p53 was a key regulator. Moreover, it was found that 6-gingerol could increase the levels of p53 mRNA in all leukemic cell lines. Thus, 6-gingerol has shown to have anti-cancer activity. In addition, p53, BAX and BCL2 could be involved in the apoptosis pathway of these leukemic cells.

L\u00e9vy walks have been found to optimize the search over a wide range of constraints. When targets are distributed within patches, generating a spatial memory over the detected targets can be beneficial towards optimizing the search efficiency. Because foragers have limited memory, storing each target location separately is unrealistic. Instead, we propose incrementally learning a spatial distribution in favour of memorizing target locations. We demonstrate that an ensemble of Gaussian mixture models is a suitable candidate for such a spatial distribution. Using this, a hybrid foraging strategy is proposed, which interchanges random searches with informed movement. Informed movement results in displacements towards target locations, and is more likely to occur if the learned spatial distribution is correct. We show that, depending on the strength of the memory effects, foragers optimize search efficiencies by continuous revisitation of non-destructive targets. However, this negatively affects both the target and patch diversity, indicating that memory does not necessarily optimize multi-objective searches. Hence, the benefits of memory depend on the specific goals of the forager. Furthermore, through analysis of the distribution over walking distances of the forager, we show that memory changes the underlying walk characteristics. Specifically, the forager resorts to Brownian motion instead of L\u00e9vy walks, due to truncation of the long straight line displacements resulting from memory effects.

Nevertheless, these interactions are commonly modeled using local (proximity) networks, in which individuals interact within a certain spatial range. Recently, other interaction topologies have been revealed to support the emergence of higher levels of scalability and rapid information exchange. One prominent example is scale-free networks. In this study, we aim to examine the impact of scale-free communication when implemented for a swarm foraging task in dynamic environments. We model dynamic (uncertain) environments in terms of changes in food density and analyze the collective response of a simulated swarm with communication topology given by either proximity or scale-free networks. Our results suggest that scale-free networks accelerate the process of building up a rapid collective response to cope with the environment changes. However, this comes at the cost of lower coherence of the collective decision. Moreover, our findings suggest that the use of scale-free networks can improve swarm performance due to two side-effects introduced by using long-range interactions and frequent network regeneration. The former is a topological consequence, while the latter is a necessity due to robot motion. These two effects lead to reduced spatial correlations of a robot's behavior with its neighborhood and to an enhanced opinion mixing, i.e., more diversified information sampling.

Consequently, novel antibiotics are urgently needed. Since more than half of the available antibiotics target the structurally conserved bacterial ribosomes, factors involved in protein synthesis are thus prime targets for the development of novel antibiotics. However, experimental identification of these potential antibiotic target proteins can be labor-intensive and challenging, as these proteins are likely to be poorly characterized and specific to few bacteria. Here, we use a bioinformatics approach to identify novel components of protein synthesis. Results In order to identify these novel proteins, we established a Large-Scale Transcriptomic Analysis Pipeline in Crowd (LSTrAP-Crowd), where 285 individuals processed 26 terabytes of RNA-sequencing data of the 17 most notorious bacterial pathogens. In total, the crowd processed 26,269 RNA-seq experiments and used the data to construct gene co-expression networks, which were used to identify more than a hundred uncharacterized genes that were transcriptionally associated with protein synthesis. We provide the identity of these genes together with the processed gene expression data.

We adopt the evolution principle and then propose a very simple and intuitive new model for network growth, which naturally evolves modular networks with multiple communities. The number and size of the communities evolve over time and are primarily subjected to a single free parameter. Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures\u2014branches and leaves of a tree. Results also show that new communities will absorb a link resource to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes. Our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and also breaks the tyranny of the early adopter; unlike the standard popularity principle, newer nodes and communities will come to dominance over time.

Here, we employed an unsupervised network-based method to recognize the position and occurrence time of the solar flares by using the ultraviolet emission (1600\u2009\u00c5) recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory. Three different regions, the flaring active regions, the non-flaring active regions, and the quiet-Sun regions, were considered to study the variations of the network parameters in the presence and absence of flaring phases in various datasets over time intervals of several hours. The whole parts of the selected datasets were partitioned into sub-windows to construct networks based on computing the Pearson correlation between time series of the region of interest and intensities. Analyzing the network parameters such as the clustering coefficient, degree centrality, characteristic length, and PageRank verified that flare triggering has an influence on the network parameters around the flare occurrence time and close to the location of flaring. It was found that the values of the clustering coefficient and characteristic length approach those obtained for the corresponding random network in the flaring phase.

FFR is of fundamental importance for pitch and speech perception and serves as clinical biomarkers for various auditory and language disorders. While it is suggested that the main neural source of FFR is in the auditory brainstem, recent studies have shown a cortical contribution to FFR predominantly in the right hemisphere. However, it is still unclear whether auditory cortex and FFR are causally related. The aim of this study was to establish this causal relationship using a combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). We applied tDCS over the left and right auditory cortices in right-handed normal-hearing participants and examined the after-effects of tDCS on FFR using EEG during monaural listening to a repeatedly-presented speech syllable. Our results showed that: (1) before tDCS was applied, participants had greater FFR magnitude when they listened to speech from the left than the right ear, illustrating right-lateralized hemispheric asymmetry for FFR; (2) anodal and cathodal tDCS applied over the right, but not left, auditory cortex significantly changed FFR magnitudes compared to the sham stimulation; specifically, such after-effects occurred only when participants listened to speech from the left ear, emphasizing the right auditory cortical contributions along the contralateral pathway. The current finding thus provides the first causal evidence that validates the relationship between the right auditory cortex and speech-evoked FFR and should significantly extend our understanding of speech encoding in the brain. Significance Statement Speech-evoked frequency-following response (FFR) is a neural activity that reflects the brain\u2019s encoding of speech periodic features. The FFR has great fundamental and clinical importance for auditory processing. Whilst convention maintains that FFR derives mainly from the brainstem, it has been argued recently that there are additional contributions to FFR from the auditory cortex. Using a combination of tDCS, that altered neural excitability of auditory cortices, and EEG recording, the present study provided the first evidence to validate a causal relationship between the right auditory cortex and speech-evoked FFR. The finding supports the right-asymmetric auditory cortical contributions to processing of speech periodicity and advances our understanding of how speech signals are encoded and analysed along the central auditory pathways.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 125, "citationCount": 1, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10133107/7/Howell_Causal%20relationship%20between%20the%20right%20auditory%20cortex%20and%20speech-evoked%20envelope-following%20response_AOP.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Psychology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Psychology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2020-03-10", "authors": [{"authorId": "2275526", "name": "Guangting Mai"}, {"authorId": "144717044", "name": "P.

A demand in a mathematical notion that properly reflects complexity of hierarchical nonrandom structures exists in many areas of science, from geology to social sciences. Here, we propose an easy to compute, robust, and universal definition of complexity based on interscale dissimilarity of patterns. Using classical magnetic patterns as an example, we demonstrate that our approach leads to maximization of complexity for the most visually nontrivial patterns and can be used to detect phase transitions with high accuracy, making it a promising tool for studying pattern formation in a variety of systems. Complexity of patterns is key information for human brain to differ objects of about the same size and shape. Like other innate human senses, the complexity perception cannot be easily quantified. We propose a transparent and universal machine method for estimating structural (effective) complexity of two-dimensional and three-dimensional patterns that can be straightforwardly generalized onto other classes of objects. It is based on multistep renormalization of the pattern of interest and computing the overlap between neighboring renormalized layers. This way, we can define a single number characterizing the structural complexity of an object. We apply this definition to quantify complexity of various magnetic patterns and demonstrate that not only does it reflect the intuitive feeling of what is \u201ccomplex\u201d and what is \u201csimple\u201d but also, can be used to accurately detect different phase transitions and gain information about dynamics of nonequilibrium systems.

Existing approaches to single source SimRank computation incur either long query response time, or expensive pre-computation, which needs to be performed again whenever the graph G changes. Consequently, to our knowledge none of them is ideal for scenarios in which (i) query processing must be done in realtime, and (ii) the underlying graph G is massive, with frequent updates. Motivated by this, we propose SimPush, a novel algorithm that answers single source SimRank queries without any pre-computation, and achieves significantly higher query speed than even the fastest known index-based solutions. Further, SimPush provides rigorous result quality guarantees, and its high performance does not rely on any strong assumption of the graph. Specifically, compared to existing methods, SimPush employs a radically different algorithmic design that focuses on (i) identifying a small number of nodes relevant to the query, and subsequently (ii) computing statistics and performing residue push from these nodes only. We prove the correctness of SimPush, analyze its time complexity, and compare its asymptotic performance with that of existing methods. Meanwhile, we evaluate the practical performance of SimPush through extensive experiments on 9 real datasets. The results demonstrate that SimPush consistently outperforms all existing solutions, often by over an order of magnitude. In particular, on a commodity machine, SimPush answers a single source SimRank query on a web graph containing over 133 million nodes and 5.4 billion edges in under 62 milliseconds, with 0.00035 empirical error, while the fastest index-based competitor needs 1.18 seconds.", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08082", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "35774994", "name": "Jieming Shi"}, {"authorId": "28449813", "name": "Tianyuan Jin"}, {"authorId": "2115421976", "name": "Renchi Yang"}, {"authorId": "33285410", "name": "Xiaokui Xiao"}, {"authorId": "47796371", "name": "Y.

Yet, its mathematical properties are still poorly understood. \nThe difficulty in PLFit is that it is a minimum-distance estimator. It first chooses a threshold that minimizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the data points larger than the threshold and the Pareto tail, and then applies the Hill estimator to this restricted data. Since the number of order statistics used is random, the general theory of consistency of power-law exponents from extreme value theory does not apply. Our proof consists in first showing that the Hill estimator is consistent for general intermediate sequences for the number of order statistics used, even when that number is random. Here, we call a sequence intermediate when it grows to infinity, while remaining much smaller than the sample size. The second, and most involved, step is to prove that the optimizer in PLFit is with high probability an intermediate sequence, unless the distribution has a Pareto tail above a certain value.

We investigate the role of community structure in the controllability of structural brain networks.

We highlight the complexity of the relationship between community structure and controllability by performing numerical simulations using canonical graph models with varying mesoscale architectures and edge weight distributions. Finally, we demonstrate that weighted subgraph centrality, a measure rooted in the graph spectrum, and which captures higher order graph architecture, is a stronger and more consistent predictor of controllability.

In addition to the well-known random link rewiring (RLR) attack, two heuristic attacks are formulated and simulated: degree-addition-based link rewiring (DALR) and degree-interval-based link rewiring (DILR). These three strategies are applied to attack a number of strong scale-free networks of various sizes generated from the Barabasi-Albert model. It is found that both DALR and DILR are more effective than RLR, in the sense that rewiring a smaller number of links can succeed in the same attack. However, DILR is as concealed as RLR in the sense that they both are constructed by introducing a relatively small number of changes on several typical structural properties such as average shortest path-length, average clustering coefficient, and average diagonal distance.

However, only a few studies have investigated the expression and transcriptional coordination of Selaginella genes, precluding us from understanding the evolution of the transcriptional programs behind these traits. We present a gene expression atlas comprising all major organs, tissue types, and the diurnal gene expression profiles for S. moellendorffii.

We demonstrate how secondary metabolism is transcriptionally coordinated and integrated with other cellular pathways. Finally, we identify root-specific genes and show that the evolution of roots did not coincide with an increased appearance of gene families, suggesting that the development of new organs does not coincide with increased fixation of new gene functions.

Critics argue that measuring the temporal evolution of a network directly is better than measuring the degree distribution when looking for preferential attachment. However, many of the established methods do not account for any potential time-dependence in the attachment kernels of growing networks, or methods assume that node degree is the key observable determining network evolution. In this paper, we argue that these assumptions may lead to misleading conclusions about the evolution of growing networks. We illustrate this by introducing a simple adaptation of the Barab{\\'a}si-Albert model, the \"k2 model\", where new nodes attach to nodes in the existing network in proportion to the number of nodes one or two steps from the target node. The k2 model results in time dependent degree distributions and attachment kernels, despite initially appearing to grow as linear preferential attachment, and without the need to include explicit time dependence in key network parameters (such as the average out-degree). We show that similar effects are seen in several real world networks where constant network growth rules do not describe their evolution.

This is why I look into forest succession in light of the Red Queen hypothesis and focus on the key aspects of ecological self-organisation: dynamical criticality, evolvability and intransitivity. The idea of the review is that forest climax should be associated with habitat dynamics driven by a large continuum of ecologically equivalent time scales, so that the same ecological conclusions could be drawn statistically from any scale. A synthesis of the literature is undertaken in order to (1) present the framework for assessing habitat dynamics and (2) present the types of successional trajectories based on tree regeneration mode in forest gaps. In general, there are four types of successional trajectories within the process-pattern of forest regeneration that exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions: advance reproduction specialists, advance reproduction generalists, early reproduction generalists and early reproduction specialists.

This study applied social network analysis approaches to examine patterns of #COVID19 information flow on Twitter. A total of 1,404,496 publicly available tweets from 946,940 U.S. users were retrieved and analyzed. Particular attention was paid to the structures of retweet and mention networks and identification of influential users: information sources, disseminators, and brokers. Overall, COVID-19 information was not transmitted efficiently. Findings pointed to the importance of fostering connections between clusters to promote the diffusion in both networks. Lots of localized clusters limited the spread of timely information, causing difficulty in establishing any momentum in shaping urgent public actions. Rather than health and communication professionals, there was dominant involvement of non-professional users responsible for major COVID-19 information generation and dissemination, suggesting a lack of credibility and accuracy in the information. Inadequate influence of health officials and government agencies in brokering information contributed to concerns about the spread of dis/misinformation to the public.

In this paper we examine the extent to which homophily is sufficient to produce the typical structural properties of social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on the Social Distance Attachment (SDA) model, a particular kind of Random Geometric Graph (RGG), in which nodes are embedded in a social space and connection probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We derive the form of the model from first principles based on existing analytical results and argue that the mathematical construction of RGGs corresponds directly to the homophily principle, so they provide a good model for it. We find that homophily, especially when combined with a random edge rewiring, is sufficient to reproduce many of the characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with the configuration model that allows generating homophilic networks with arbitrary degree sequences and we use it to study interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions.

If this is the case, inter-event times should approximately obey a mixture of exponential distributions with different parameter values. In the present study, we introduce the minimum description length principle to compare mixtures of exponential distributions with different numbers of components (i.e. constituent exponential distributions). Because these distributions violate the identifiability property, one is mathematically not allowed to apply the Akaike or Bayes information criteria to their maximum-likelihood estimator to carry out model selection. We overcome this theoretical barrier by applying a minimum description principle to joint likelihoods of the data and latent variables. We show that mixtures of exponential distributions with a few components are selected, as opposed to more complex mixtures in various datasets, and that the fitting accuracy is comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms to fit power-law distributions to data.

The wide variations in 27 attack rate observed among different social strata suggest that this may be due to social 28 heterogeneity not accounted for by regional models. We investigated this hypothesis by 29 developing and using a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM) that focuses on 30 subpopulations that are vulnerable in the sense of having an increased likelihood of spreading 31 infection among themselves. We found that the isolation or embedding of vulnerable sub-clusters 32 in a major population hub generated complex stochastic infection patterns which included 33 multiple peaks and growth periods, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second 34 wave of infection. Embedded vulnerable groups became hotspots that drove infection despite 35 efforts of the main population to socially distance, while isolated groups suffered delayed but 36 intense infection. Amplification of infection by these hotspots facilitated transmission from one 37 urban area to another, causing the epidemic to hopscotch in a stochastic manner to places it 38 would not otherwise reach, resembling a microcosm of the situation worldwide as of September 39 2020. Our results suggest that social heterogeneity is a key factor in the formation of complex 40 infection propagation patterns. Thus, the mitigation of vulnerable groups is essential to control 41 the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. The design of our new model allows it to be applied in 42 future studies of real-world scenarios on any scale, limited only by computing memory and the 43 ability to determine the underlying topology and parameters. 44", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "36827779", "name": "A.

In this work, we will contribute to insight regarding the inspection regime by examining ship movements in Europe using network analysis. This research will focus on the connection between ships, ports, and inter-ship timing. From a data set encompassing more than 3 million measurements of ships calling at more than 2000 ports in Europe between 2015-2019, we extract four different kinds of networks. First, in the ship-visiting network, nodes are ports and edges represent ships sailing between two ports. The obtained ship-visiting network has various properties common to the global ship network. Also, regional communities were found in the ship-visiting network, indicating ships have a preference for sailing in specific regions in Europe. Second, in the port-sharing network, nodes are ships and edges represent two ships visiting the same ports. Third, in the route-sharing network nodes are ships and edges represent two ships sailing the same routes. The port-sharing network and routesharing network show ships tend to be selective in the ports they visit. Lastly, in the co-sailing network nodes are ships and edges represent pairs of ships that are systematically sailing together. There is some form of co-sailing behaviour present in Europe. This study improved understanding of ship traffic behaviour, which has implications for society and the environment.

Buses, subways, trains, etc., are a part of our everyday life. They are how we commute to work, meet a friend for a coffee and visit or travel to different places. In the last decades, researches have studied the topology and characteristics of Public Transport Networks (PTN) in order to understand, plan and optimize their behaviour, cost and performance. In particular, when dealing with spatial networks such as PTNs, complex network theory plays a huge role in analysing and understanding their properties. In this thesis we focus on the PTNs analysis of 27 cities located in three continents: Europe (19), Oceania (5) and America (3). We model each transportation network as a graph represented by an L-space topology, where stops and stations represent nodes and their connections edges, e.g., a bus going from stop A to stop B. This work aims at finding possible relations/patterns involving the city features, such as area and population, and the properties of its PTN. We collect basic static measurements for each city, such as number of nodes and edges, clustering coefficient, density and diameter. We deepen the network analysis discussing assortativity and average path length. We further explore the properties of each network through the distributions of node measures, like degree and different types of centrality. We then explore the networks in order to analyse shortest paths and distances, computed by standard graph algorithms and evaluated taking into account Euclidean distances. This allows us to partially capture some geographical, topological and functional characteristics of the observed networks. We conclude our work with a frequency analysis. The goal is to display and analyse the distributions of number of vehicles throughout a typical day.

Moreover, this article proposes a pipeline for constructing an unweighted functional brain network from EEG data using both source and sensor methods. Out of 57 articles, our results show that graph theory metrics used to characterize EEG data have attracted increasing attention since 2006, with the highest frequency of publications in 2018.

The mean phase coherence method, based on the \u201cphase-locking value,\u201d was the most frequently used functional estimation technique in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, the unweighted functional brain network has received substantially more attention in the literature than the weighted network. The global clustering coefficient and characteristic path length were the most prevalent metrics for differentiating between global integration and local segregation, and the small-worldness property emerged as a compelling metric for the characterization of information processing.

An external manifestation of this condition is the spread of avalanches of microposts on the network.

Visibility in journals is important because we work in an attention economy. It could lead us to success through attention. Knowing who and how is present in our professional knowledge networks could help us to understand our positions in our professional communities. There are various conceptions of visibility. We refer to productivity and network presence of authors in publication networks. According to earlier scientometric and network research, in authorship networks distribution of productivity and co-authorship collaboration is unequal. Some authors are highly visible in the publication network, but many of them are on the periphery. We can measure visibility in various ways; we chose scientometric and network measures published in earlier studies. Our goal was to measure the visibility of authors (n=4281) who published in leading Hungarian educational journals (n=4) between 1991 and 2016. We focused on and compared the publication productivity, the co-authorship collaborators and collaborations as well as the co-authorship fitness of authors. Our results supported the assumptions of the powerlaw distribution of the measured indicators. Besides this, our analysis showed that the positions - the rankings of authors - is different in most of the measures, still we found moderate to strong correlations between them. \n \nKeywords: scientific visibility, productivity, co-authorship, network analysis, journals, education, co-authorship fitness", "venue": "Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3s T\u00e1rsadalom", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 95, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Political Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Political Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-11-26", "authors": [{"authorId": "2068050955", "name": "P\u00e1l Moln\u00e1r"}, {"authorId": "119674554", "name": "Henriett Pint\u00e9r"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "18a84b8426f94f1d52fbb10bc844b82f04c54223", "corpusId": 208210976, "title": "Power-law distributions of corporate innovative output: evidence from U.S. patent data", "abstract": null, "venue": "Scientometrics", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 116, "citationCount": 5, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Economics", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Economics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Economics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Business", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-22", "authors": [{"authorId": "83500896", "name": "Mincheol Choi"}, {"authorId": "98660257", "name": "Chang\u2010Yang Lee"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "a7cdd72b53ed5f00f55334cc16623c7a6a181b8e", "corpusId": 208535259, "title": "Network analysis of swine movements in a multi-site pig production system in Iowa, USA.", "abstract": null, "venue": "Preventive Veterinary Medicine", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 20, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Agricultural And Food Sciences", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-11-20", "authors": [{"authorId": "4857857", "name": "T.

So we design a self-adapting switching (SAS) algorithm, where weak communities are detected by combination of two affinities.

Initial claims based on least-square fitting suggested that brain functional connectivity networks obey power law scaling in their degree distributions. This interpretation has been challenged on methodological grounds. Subsequently, estimators based on maximum-likelihood and non-parametric tests involving surrogate data have been proposed. No clear consensus has emerged as results especially depended on data resolution. To identify the underlying topological distribution of brain functional connectivity calls for a closer examination of the relationship between resolution and statistics of model fitting. In this study, we analyze high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project to assess its degree distribution across resolutions. We consider resolutions from one thousand to eighty thousand regions of interest (ROIs) and test whether they follow a heavy or short-tailed distribution. We analyze power law, exponential, truncated power law, log-normal, Weibull and generalized Pareto probability distributions. Notably, the Generalized Pareto distribution is of particular interest since it interpolates between heavy-tailed and short-tailed distributions, and it provides a handle on estimating the tail\u2019s heaviness or shortness directly from the data. Our results show that the statistics support the short-tailed limit of the generalized Pareto distribution, rather than a power law or any other heavy-tailed distribution. Working across resolutions of the data and performing cross-model comparisons, we further establish the overall robustness of the generalized Pareto model in explaining the data. Moreover, we account for earlier ambiguities by showing that down-sampling the data systematically affects statistical results. At lower resolutions models cannot easily be differentiated on statistical grounds while their plausibility consistently increases up to an upper bound. Indeed, more power law distributions are reported at low resolutions (5K) than at higher ones (50K or 80K). However, we show that these positive identifications at low resolutions fail cross-model comparisons and that down-sampling data introduces the risk of detecting spurious heavy-tailed distributions. This dependence of the statistics of degree distributions on sampling resolution has broader implications for neuroinformatic methodology, especially, when several analyses rely on down-sampled data, for instance, due to a choice of anatomical parcellations or measurement technique. Our findings that node degrees of human brain functional networks follow a short-tailed distribution have important implications for claims of brain organization and function. Our findings do not support common simplistic representations of the brain as a generic complex system with optimally efficient architecture and function, modeled with simple growth mechanisms. Instead these findings reflect a more nuanced picture of a biological system that has been shaped by longstanding and pervasive developmental and architectural constraints, including wiring-cost constraints on the centrality architecture of individual nodes.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://authors.library.caltech.edu/99824/1/840066.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-11-13", "authors": [{"authorId": "34581273", "name": "R.

We here studied the connectivity of the human protein-protein interaction network (i.e., the interactome) to find the nodes whose removal has the heaviest impact on the network, i.e., maximizes its fragmentation. Such nodes are known as Critical Nodes (CNs). Specifically, we implemented a Critical Node Heuristic (CNH) and compared its performance against other four heuristics based on well known centrality measures. To better understand the structure of the interactome, the CNs\u2019 role played in the network, and the different heuristics\u2019 capabilities to grasp biologically relevant nodes, we compared the sets of nodes identified as CNs by each heuristic with two experimentally validated sets of essential genes, i.e., the genes whose removal impact on a given organism\u2019s ability to survive. Our results show that classical centrality measures (i.e., closeness centrality, degree) found more essential genes with respect to CNH on the current version of the human interactome, however the removal of such nodes does not have the greatest impact on interactome connectivity, while, interestingly, the genes identified by CNH show peculiar characteristics both from the topological and the biological point of view.

These regions communicate with each other to share information involved in complex cognitive processes. Functional connectivity (FC) represents the level of synchronization between different brain regions/networks. Studying functional interactions of the brain creates a platform for understanding functional architecture of the brain as an integrative network and has implications for understanding human cognition. Furthermore, there is evidence that FC patterns are sensitive to different diseases. In addition, age is a significant determinant of intra-/inter-individual variability in the FC patterns. Therefore, key aims for the studies included in this thesis were to apply and develop novel resting-state FC methodologies, with applications in healthy aging and ADHD. Indeed, measures of the brain\u2019s FC may serve as a useful tool to diagnose and predict the course of disease, and useful in developing individualized therapies. Ageor disease-related alterations in the FC could reflect a multitude of factors, including changes in structural connectivity. However, we still have limited knowledge of the emergence of brain dynamics from the underlying anatomy. The interplay between the brain\u2019s structure and dynamics underlies all brain functions. Therefore, in the last study we focused on the systematic modeling of the brain network dynamics. Large-scale computational models are uniquely suited to address difficult questions related to the role of brain\u2019s structural network in shaping functional interactions. In addition, computational modeling of the brain enables us to test different hypotheses without any experimental complication while it provides us with a platform for improving our understanding of different brain mechanisms. A new macroscopic computational model of the brain oscillations for resting-state fMRI was introduced in this thesis, which outperforms previous model in the same class. Then, the effects of malfunctions in different brain regions were simulated and subsequently predicted perturbation patterns were recruited for local vulnerability mapping as well as quantification of hazard rates induced after perturbing any brain region.

We show that a rich class of network evolution models can be built from a weighted mixture of these model mechanisms. Using a likelihood based formulation we show how to calculate the optimal mixture for a given set of observations of network data, and show that this framework can be used to distinguish competing models that are indistinguishable by their summary statistics. Using real data from Facebook user interactions, we show that we can improve the ability of a model to reproduce network statistics using tuned model mixtures. We further investigate the idea that the underlying model of a network can change in time, for example, a technology based network might respond to changes in the underlying technology or a financial network might respond to economic shocks.

A variety of methods have been used to infer properties of the constituent diseases or underlying populations from the network structure, but few have been validated or reproduced. Objectives To test the robustness and sensitivity of several common CNA techniques to the source of population health data and the method of link determination. Methods We obtained six sources of aggregated disease co-occurrence data, coded using varied ontologies, most of which were provided by the authors of CNAs. We constructed families of comorbidity networks from these data sets, in which links were determined using a range of statistical thresholds and measures of association. We calculated degree distributions, single-value statistics, and centrality rankings for these networks and evaluated their sensitivity to the source of data and link determination parameters. From two open-access sources of patient-level data, we constructed comorbidity networks using several multivariate models in addition to comparable pairwise models and evaluated differences between correlation estimates and network structure. Results Global network statistics vary widely depending on the underlying population. Much of this variation is due to network density, which for our six data sets ranged over three orders of magnitude. The statistical threshold for link determination also had strong effects on global statistics, though at any fixed threshold the same patterns distinguished our six populations. The association measure used to quantify comorbid relations had smaller but discernible effects on global structure. Co-occurrence rates estimated using multivariate models were increasingly negative-shifted as models accounted for more effects. However, only associations between the most prevalent disorders were consistent from model to model. Centrality rankings were likewise similar when based on the same dataset using different constructions; but they were difficult to compare, and very different when comparable, between data sets, especially those using different ontologies. The most central disease codes were particular to the underlying populations and were often broad categories, injuries, or non-specific symptoms. Conclusions CNAs can improve robustness and comparability by accounting for known limitations. In particular, we urge comorbidity network analysts (a) to include, where permissible, disaggregated disease occurrence data to allow more targeted reproduction and comparison of results; (b) to report differences in results obtained using different association measures, including both one of relative risk and one of correlation; (c) when identifying centrally located disorders, to carefully decide the most suitable ontology for this purpose; and, (d) when relevant to the interpretation of results, to compare them to those obtained using a multivariate model.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/05/752964.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-09-05", "authors": [{"authorId": "34659272", "name": "J.

To some surprise, these have been shown to share a number of structural properties regardless of their type or origin. It is thus of vital importance to design simple and intuitive models that can explain their intrinsic structure and dynamics. These can, for instance, be used to study networks analytically or to construct networks not observed in real life. Most models proposed in the literature are of two types. A model can be either static, where edges are added between a fixed set of nodes according to some predefined rule, or evolving, where the number of nodes or edges increases over time. However, some real networks do not grow but rather shrink, meaning that the number of nodes or edges decreases over time. We here propose a simple model of shrinking networks called the war pact model. We show that networks generated in such a way exhibit common structural properties of real networks. Furthermore, compared to classical models, these resemble international trade, correlates of war, Bitcoin transactions and other networks more closely.

The SCN is composed of about 20,000 neurons that are autonomous oscillators with nonidentical intrinsic periods ranging from 22 h to 28 h. These neurons are coupled through neurotransmitters and synchronized to form a network, which produces a robust circadian rhythm of a uniform period. The neurons, which are the nodes in the network, are known to be heterogeneous in their characteristics, which is reflected in different phenotypes and different functionality. This heterogeneous nature of the nodes of the network leads to the question as to whether the structure of the SCN network is assortative or disassortative. Thus far, the disassortativity of the SCN network has not been assessed and neither have its effects on the collective behaviors of the SCN neurons. In the present study, we build a directed SCN network composed of hundreds of neurons for a single slice using the method of transfer entropy, based on the experimental data. Then, we measured the synchronization degree as well as the disassortativity coefficient of the network structure (calculated by either the out-degrees or the in-degrees of the nodes) and found that the network of the SCN is a disassortative network. Furthermore, a positive relationship is observed between the synchronization degree and disassortativity of the network, which is confirmed by simulations of our modeling. Our finding suggests that the disassortativity of the network structure plays a role in the synchronization between SCN neurons; that is, the synchronization degree increases with the increase of the disassortativity, which implies that a more heterogeneous coupling in the network of the SCN is important for proper function of the SCN.", "venue": "Journal of Biological Rhythms", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount": 9, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2019-07-18", "authors": [{"authorId": "7395842", "name": "C.

As transcription factors are themselves proteins, they are part of a complex interconnected and self-regulated network. We define the transcription factor basal regulatory network (TFBRN) as the network formed by the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) as proteins acting on target genes which are themselves TFs. The question then becomes as to whether topological features of this network are important in determining phenotypes caused by perturbations in TFs. To explore this, we developed two simple TFBRN models; one based on data from human TFs, and the other on the budding yeast. Even from this basic model we did find some very clear correlations between local topological measures and phenotypes seen in cancer and rare genetic diseases. This strongly suggests that the local network architecture of the TFBRN provides important information around the roles of transcription factors and the impacts to an organisation of their perturbation. Author Summary The human body is controlled by proteins whose production is coordinated by proteins known as transcription factors. These transcription factors can control multiple proteins, including other transcription factors. Does this network itself play any role in determining the properties of the transcription factors and their roles in cancer and disease? In this paper we find that there is a relationship between the local structures in the network and processes such as cancer and rare genetic diseases. We also found a similar relationship between local network characteristics and budding yeast phenotypes. This work therefore shows that simple properties of the network of interactions between transcription factors and their targets can be useful in determining the effects caused by changes in transcription factors (whether through deletion or allelic variation).", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/12/669697.full.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-12", "authors": [{"authorId": "1441269888", "name": "Jl Hern\u00e1ndez-Dom\u00ednguez"}, {"authorId": "50325336", "name": "A.

The problem we intend to tackle in this paper is to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we had already measured in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold from a precise mathematical point of view, since, although shown as pervasive in the software engineering literature (and others), power laws are more elusive than they might seem at first sight.

A quite remarkable feature of many of these networks is that they are believed to be approximately scale free: the fraction of nodes with $k$ incident links (the degree) follows a power law $p(k)\\propto k^{-\\lambda}$ for sufficiently large degree $k$. The value of the exponent $\\lambda$ as well as deviations from power law scaling provide invaluable information on the mechanisms underlying the formation of the network such as small degree saturation, variations in the local fitness to compete for links, and high degree cutoffs owing to the finite size of the network. Indeed real networks are not infinitely large and the largest degree of any network cannot be larger than the number of nodes. Finite size scaling is a useful tool for analyzing deviations from power law behavior in the vicinity of a critical point in a physical system arising due to a finite correlation length. Here we show that despite the essential differences between networks and critical phenomena, finite size scaling provides a powerful framework for analyzing self-similarity and the scale free nature of empirical networks. We analyze about two hundred naturally occurring networks with distinct dynamical origins, and find that a large number of these follow the finite size scaling hypothesis without any self-tuning. Notably this is the case of biological protein interaction networks, technological computer and hyperlink networks and informational citation and lexical networks. Marked deviations appear in other examples, especially infrastructure and transportation networks, but also social, affiliation and annotation networks.

In this paper we present a specific Triangle Generalized Preferential Attachment Model (TGPA) that, by construction, has nontrivial clustering. We further prove that this model has a power-law in both the degree distribution and eigenvalue spectra. We use this model to investigate a recent finding that power-laws are more reliably observed in the eigenvalue spectra of real-world networks than in their degree distribution. One conjectured explanation for this is that the spectra of the graph is more robust to various sampling strategies that would have been employed to collect the real-world data compared with the degree distribution. Consequently, we generate random TGPA models that provably have a power-law in both, and sample subgraphs via forest fire, depth-first, and random edge models. We find that the samples show a power-law in the spectra even when only 30\\% of the network is seen. Whereas there is a large chance that the degrees will not show a power-law. Our TGPA model shows this behavior much more clearly than a standard preferential attachment model.

Given the interaction among multiple messages involved in a diffusion process and the rich intertwined effects, a diffusion model based on multiple messages and multiplex network space is proposed. The proposed model attempts to explore the internal mechanism related to concurrent diffusion of multiple messages relative to social topics. First, aiming at the multidimensional characteristics of the diffusion space, the overlap of social structure, and the complexity of diffusion behavior are mined and mapped to a multiplex diffusion space. Through hierarchical processing, multidimensional message diffusion paths can be constructed, and the diffusion situation of each message can be further perceived. In addition, because, in information diffusion, the infectious rate depends on the time change, the time-dependent variables associated with interaction among multiple messages are introduced. In this manner, the diffusion process of mutual promotion (cooperative relationship) and restraint (competitive relationship) between multiple messages can be revealed. Finally, considering information interaction and diffusion network complexity, a dynamic interaction mechanism based on the multiplex SIS diffusion model is introduced. A unified framework of multiple messages coupled dynamic processes is constructed using a discrete-time microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA).

In particular, reservoir computing turned out to be a very promising approach especially for the reproduction of the long-term properties of a nonlinear system. Yet, a thorough statistical analysis of the forecast results is missing. Using the Lorenz and R\u00f6ssler system, we statistically analyze the quality of prediction for different parametrizations-both the exact short-term prediction as well as the reproduction of the long-term properties (the \"climate\") of the system as estimated by the correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. We find that both short- and long-term predictions vary significantly among the realizations. Thus, special care must be taken in selecting the good predictions as realizations, which deliver better short-term prediction also tend to better resemble the long-term climate of the system. Instead of only using purely random Erd\u00f6s-Renyi networks, we also investigate the benefit of alternative network topologies such as small world or scale-free networks and show which effect they have on the prediction quality. Our results suggest that the overall performance with respect to the reproduction of the climate of both the Lorenz and R\u00f6ssler system is worst for scale-free networks. For the Lorenz system, there seems to be a slight benefit of using small world networks, while for the R\u00f6ssler system, small world and Erd\u00f6s-Renyi networks performed equivalently well.

The actual scale-free networking of urban street networks in their topological space, where navigation information is encoded by mapping roads to nodes and junctions to links between nodes, has still no simple explanation. Emphasizing the road-junction hierarchy in a holistic and systematic way leads us to envisage urban street networks as evolving social systems subject to a Boltzmann-mesoscopic entropy conservation. This conservation, which we may interpret in terms of surprisal, ensures the passage from the road-junction hierarchy to a scale-free coherence. To wit, we recover the actual scale-free probability distribution for natural roads in self-organized cities. We obtain this passage by invoking Jaynes's Maximum Entropy principle (statistical physics), while we capitalize on modern ideas of quantification (information physics) and well known results on structuration (lattice theory) to measure the information network entropy.

However, the probability of connecting to existing nodes, and consequently the likelihood function itself, varies as networks grow. We establish conditions under which applying likelihood analysis guarantees the existence of a local maximum of the time-varying likelihood function and prove that an expectation maximization algorithm provides a convergent estimate.

One of the interesting phenomena driven by such heterogeneities is the friendship paradox (FP), stating that the mean degree of one's neighbors is larger than the degree of oneself. Alternatively, one can use the median degree of neighbors as well as the fraction of neighbors having a higher degree than oneself. Each of these reflects on how people perceive their neighborhoods, i.e., their perception models, hence how they feel peer pressure. In our paper, we study the impact of perception models on the FP by comparing three versions of the perception model in networks generated with a given degree distribution and a tunable degree-degree correlation or assortativity. The increasing assortativity is expected to decrease network-level peer pressure, while we find a nontrivial behavior only for the mean-based perception model. By simulating opinion formation, in which the opinion adoption probability of an individual is given as a function of individual peer pressure, we find that it takes the longest time to reach consensus when individuals adopt the median-based perception model compared to other versions.

However, some problems still remain open. One of which, the focus of our work, is the determination of a network\u2019s community structure. Even though there\u2019s no consensual formal definition, communities come from the intuitive idea that nodes form subgroups in the larger networks. In this regard, many different algorithms have been proposed in order to identify such groups. Here we tackle this problem in two different fronts: first, we developed a new algorithm based on the Surprise function and secondly, we created a novel benchmark, a set of artificial networks with a seeded community structure, to compare the performance of competing algorithms. Our own Surpriser algorithm was tested against seven other methods from the literature in three different benchmarks. We show that the Surprise based methods are the most consistent among different benchmarks, with Surpriser having an edge over the competition. Finally, we show that our benchmark is the hardest of the three as very few algorithms are able to solve it.

In b), conversely, the distribution of community sizes is wide, so that there\u2019s no clear value of \u03b3RB that balances the tension between dividing and merging communities. For small values of R we have the \u03b3RB = 1 which explains the equivalent performance between RB and Louvain.

Microbial organisms live and reproduce in almost any conceivable environment on the planet. In recent years, researchers have started to gain quantified information of the microscopic world, fueled by the technical advances in sequencing technology. From the presence of microbes in environmental samples (metagenomics) to the processes within a cell (transcriptomics), omics data has revolutionized our understanding of the microcosmos. One of the places that microbial communities inhabit is the intestines of animals. Many studies have shown that host-associated microbes have a crucial role in the development of the host and are vital for critical functions within many animals. Many studies focus their attention on the microbiota of mammals, and there has been less focus on animals in aquatic environments. The farmed Atlantic salmon is of great importance for the Norwegian economy. The Atlantic salmon is also an exciting study object due to the dramatic environmental change the fish experiences during its lifetime. The transition from freshwater to saltwater would kill most other fish and is an extreme barrier for the proliferation of the salmon\u2019s gut microbiota. In this thesis, we developed a pipeline using the R-package weighted-correlation-networkanalysis (WGCNA) to create networks and detect modules in data from a long-term feeding trial of farmed Atlantic salmon. Through the use of representative profiles for each module, this network-based dimensionality reduction approach gives a holistic approach to the discovery of potential host symbionts. Complex behaviors emerge from the pairwise interactions of individual objects on every level (genes, proteins, metabolites, cells, animals). Network analysis differs from traditional methods of data analysis by analyzing all relations between objects and studying how they behave together. In this thesis, we analyze two datasets: one of the host gene expression (RNAseq) and another for the microbial abundance (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), both of which were previously analyzed separately. We found confirmation of the central status of several bacteria as potential host-symbionts but was limited in our ability to link these bacteria to specific sets of genes by the strong effect of the freshwater-saltwater transition. A method for regressing out principal components was used to remove large effects in the data in the hopes that it would reveal the subtle interactions. Although the method was successful in discovering genes involved in lipid metabolism, the analysis showed no positive correlation between any group of genes and microorganisms. This lack of positive relationship goes against the established literature on the subject; however, there are some limitations of the method.

They are ubiquitous. Be it social media networks linking us to our friends, transportation networks interconnecting locations around the globe, or the metabolic network breaking down food in our bodies. The study of networks is an interdisciplinary field spanning from fields of mathematics, psychology, sociology, biology, computer science, physics, and many other areas. The field of Network Science has greatly profited from the contributions of such diverse scientific communities. However, there are still remaining challenges that are open for further research and discussion. The identification of influential nodes in a network is a constant challenge faced by researchers. Regardless of the specific field of study the solution to this problem is constantly in demand. In this thesis, we present a new measure for the identification of influential nodes in complex networks. It is based on a mathematical model which uses a branching process approach. Unlike a lot of existing measures, it is based on a mathematical model that takes into account not only the structure of the network but also the dynamics taking place on the network. We present the mathematical theory behind the model and explain from this where the measure will return accurate results, and when it should return inaccurate predications. Throughout this work, we provide a considerable amount of results on a range of networks. We do this to support our proposal and recommendations for the usage of this new centrality metric.

This study addresses the subject, using traditional music analysis, data-driven corpus methods, and computational models, concentrating on historical changes of tonality with a particular focus on the 19th century. The thesis engages three analytical levels of increasing scope\u2014 micro, meso, and macro\u2014and is thus located between the poles of the particular and the general. The micro-level presents a detailed analysis of Franz Liszt\u2019s Sonetto 47 del Petrarca, S. 161, no. 4 (1858), in order to illustrate compositional innovations testifying to the radical changes in tonality within the 19th century. The analysis exemplifies how these novelties permeate musical compositions in that period, and also expose the benefits and limitations of manual music analysis. The meso-level examines a corpus of harmonic annotations of pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Medtner, containing over 75,000 chord symbols. It presents a comprehensive model for the analysis of chord symbols in large corpora in order to study chords and the progressions between them. Whilst the individual composers\u2019 chord vocabularies vary considerably\u2014paying tribute to idiomatic usages of harmony\u2014it is shown that the overarching similarities of the chord distributions point to similarities in their harmonic language that surpass individual traits and that can be modeled by Zipf\u2019s and Heaps\u2019s laws. An entropy-based method is presented to systematically study the effect of certain features on chord prediction, revealing that suspensions are the strongest predictors. The study shows that chord progressions are largely asymmetrical and proceed mostly by fifths; however, third-based progressions become increasingly prevalent within the studied period. The macro-level explores a corpus of nearly 3 million notes in more than 2000 pieces created by 75 composers, comprising a historical range of approximately 600 years. The encoding of the data distinguishes enharmonically equivalent notes, hence providing a larger note vocabulary than most previous approaches in empirical music research. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the line of fifths can be derived from the co-occurrence as well as the coevolution of tonal pitch-classes. Moreover, the hierarchical topic model known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to discover latent tonal profiles. These largely correspond to distributions on contiguous line-of-fifths segments and moreover demonstrate the elevated roles of fifths as well as major and minor thirds as intervals between the most frequent notes.

They have gathered a lot of interest, as they may describe functional dependencies of complex networks and yield insights into their basic structure [Milo et al., 2002]. Therefore, a large amount of work went into the development of methods for network motif detection in complex networks [Kashtan et al., 2004; Schreiber and Schwobbermeyer, 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Wernicke, 2006; Grochow and Kellis, 2007; Alon et al., 2008; Omidi et al., 2009]. The underlying problem of motif detection is to count how often a copy of a pattern graph H occurs in a target graph G. This problem is #W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of H [Flum and Grohe, 2004] and cannot be solved in time f(|H|)n^o(|H|) under #ETH [Chen et al., 2005]. \nPreferential attachment graphs [Barabasi and Albert, 1999] are a very popular random graph model designed to mimic complex networks. They are constructed by a random process that iteratively adds vertices and attaches them preferentially to vertices that already have high degree. Preferential attachment has been empirically observed in real growing networks [Newman, 2001; Jeong et al., 2003]. \nWe show that one can count subgraph copies of a graph H in the preferential attachment graph G^n_m (with n vertices and nm edges, where m is usually a small constant) in expected time f(|H|) m^O(|H|^6) log(n)^O(|H|^12) n. This means the motif counting problem can be solved in expected quasilinear FPT time on preferential attachment graphs with respect to the parameters |H| and m. In particular, for fixed H and m the expected run time is O(n^(1+epsilon)) for every epsilon>0. \nOur results are obtained using new concentration bounds for degrees in preferential attachment graphs. Assume the (total) degree of a set of vertices at a time t of the random process is d. We show that if d is sufficiently large then the degree of the same set at a later time n is likely to be in the interval (1 +/- epsilon)d sqrt(n/t) (for epsilon > 0) for all n >= t.

Additionally, we used the distributed implementation as the basis for the PageRank algorithm. Experimental results seem to indicate that data replication indeed has the potential to speed up distributed graph algorithms quite signi cantly. On a few network graphs, we observed runtime reductions of more than 25%, but only when the data assigned to each vertex was su ciently large, i.e., when communication latencies play only a small role. On other graphs however, we were not able to observe any speedups.

Through a series of log-log regressions that focus on Zipf\u2019s scaling law and settlement scaling theory, we measure population and production variables to compare Native and non-Native populations in California. We find that both groups demonstrate scaling coefficients close to 1, consistent with settlement scaling theory. When measured with radiance, there is greater variation, but California demonstrates more increase in brightness as population grows. On reservations in California and throughout the country, increases in population shows no correlation with radiance increase and this measure of infrastructure is stagnated across all cross-sections. With these findings, we conclude our test of this methodology and theory to confirm that societies scale up in productivity with population and other economic growth variables.

In recent decades, numerous metrics have been proposed with varying computation complexity. To test the idea that approximating a high-complexity metric by a low-complexity metric, researchers have studied the correlation between them. However, these works are based on Pearson correlation which is sensitive to the data distribution. Intuitively, a centrality metric is a ranking of nodes (or edges). It would be more reasonable to use rank correlation to do the measurement. In this paper, we use degree, a low-complexity metric, as the base to approximate three other metrics: closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector. We first demonstrate that rank correlation performs better than the Pearson one in scale-free networks. Then we study the correlation between centrality metrics in real networks, and find that the betweenness occupies the highest coefficient, closeness is at the middle level, and eigenvector fluctuates dramatically. At last, we evaluate the performance of using top degree nodes to approximate three other metrics in the real networks. We find that the intersection ratio of betweenness is the highest, and closeness and eigenvector follows; most often, the largest degree nodes could approximate largest betweenness and closeness nodes, but not the largest eigenvector nodes.", "venue": "Open Physics", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/journals/phys/16/1/article-p1009.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2018-12-31", "authors": [{"authorId": "3304245", "name": "Chengcheng Shao"}, {"authorId": "23161852", "name": "Pengshuai Cui"}, {"authorId": "12530383", "name": "Peng Xun"}, {"authorId": "2111035085", "name": "Yuxing Peng"}, {"authorId": "34316450", "name": "Xinwen Jiang"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "008de597c306275dde8de3ace44cfcf5355a20fc", "corpusId": 54452394, "title": "Phase Transitions in Spatial Networks as a Model of Cellular Symbiosis", "abstract": null, "venue": "International Workshop on Complex Networks & Their Applications", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount": 2, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-12-05", "authors": [{"authorId": "47868046", "name": "P.

This raises many conceptual and pragmatic issues, including misfit with the highly dynamic nature of graph processing, and could lead to resource waste and high operational costs.

However, many studies are limited to small-scale approaches; therefore, it is hard to generalize. To overcome this problem, we investigate 21 years of citation evolution through a systematic analysis of the entire citation history of 42,423,644 scientific literatures published from 1996 to 2016 and contained in SCOPUS. We tested six candidate distributions for the scientific literature in three distinct levels of Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) classification scheme. First, we observe that the raw number of annual citation acquisitions tends to follow the log-normal distribution for all disciplines, except for the first year of the publication. We also find significant disparity between the yearly acquired citation number among the journals, which suggests that it is essential to remove the citation surplus inherited from the prestige of the journals. Our simple method for separating the citation preference of an individual article from the inherited citation of the journals reveals an unexpected regularity in the normalized annual acquisitions of citations across the entire field of science.

However, previous works mainly attempt to fit or interpret empirical data distributions in a case-by-case way. Faced with complex data distributions in the real world, can we fit and interpret them by a unified but parsimonious parametric model? In this paper, we view the complex empirical data as being generated by a dynamic system which takes uniform randomness as input. By modeling the generative dynamics of data, we showcase a four-parameter dynamic model together with inference and simulation algorithms, which is able to fit and generate a family of distributions, ranging from Gaussian, Exponential, Power Law, Stretched Exponential (Weibull), to their complex variants with multi-scale complexities. Rather than a black box, our model can be interpreted by a unified differential equation, which captures the underlying generative dynamics. More powerful models can be constructed by our framework in a principled way. We validate our model by various synthetic datasets. We then apply our model to $16$ real-world datasets from different disciplines. We show the systematic biases of fitting these datasets by the most widely used methods and show the superiority of our model. In short, our model potentially provides a framework to fit complex distributions in empirical data, and more importantly, to understand their generative mechanisms.", "venue": "Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 7, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-19", "authors": [{"authorId": "3440038", "name": "Chengxi Zang"}, {"authorId": "143738684", "name": "Peng Cui"}, {"authorId": "145583986", "name": "Wenwu Zhu"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "462fb34f6558d8651562b6719b5b0eef76c15f75", "corpusId": 49863586, "title": "Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment: A New Mechanism Explaining Social Network Formation and Evolution", "abstract": null, "venue": "Scientific Reports", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29224-w.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2018-07-18", "authors": [{"authorId": "2392782", "name": "A.

Scale-free networks may provide an explanation for the robustness observed in certain physical and biological phenomena, since the presence of a few highly connected hub nodes and a large number of small- degree nodes may provide alternate paths between any two nodes on average -- such robustness has been suggested in studies of metabolic networks, gene interaction networks and protein folding. A theoretical justification for why biological networks are often found to be scale-free may lie in the well-known fact that expanding networks in which new nodes are preferentially attached to highly connected nodes tend to be scale-free. In this paper, we provide the first efficient algorithm to compute the connectivity density function for the ensemble of all secondary structures of a user-specified length, and show both by computational and theoretical arguments that preferential attachment holds when expanding the network from length n to length n + 1 structures. Since existent power-law fitting software, such as powerlaw, cannot be used to determine a power-law fit for our exponentially large RNA connectivity data, we also implement efficient code to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the power-law scaling factor and associated Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value. Statistical goodness-of-fit tests indicate that one must reject the hypothesis that RNA connectivity data follows a power-law distribution.

In detail, this dataset is composed of a total of 271 unique individuals, responsible for the delivery of a total of 721 tasks spread across a period of 745 days. The focus of this analysis is on the collaboration network between individuals, captured by their co-assignment in the delivery of particular tasks, and their dynamical patterns.

Similarly, some tasks require a disproportionately diverse set of skills to be completed, further enhancing their intrinsic complexity. Shifting focus to the topology of the contribution network, an abrupt emergence, and subsequent contraction, of a single large cluster is observed. This phenomenon corresponds to the emergence of an increasingly large and cohesive team, and its subsequent decomposition.

Rather than 'super-spreaders', we find that the presence of these highly connected 'super-blockers' in heavy-tailed networks in fact reduces the probability of global cascades, while promoting information spread when targeted as the initial spreader.", "venue": "The Web Conference", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 11, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3191590&type=pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Physics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Book", "JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2018-02-14", "authors": [{"authorId": "21546966", "name": "Caitlin Gray"}, {"authorId": "13568600", "name": "Lewis Mitchell"}, {"authorId": "1751891", "name": "M.

Their complex web of interactions is difficult to fully capture and quantify with simple mathematical objects. Applying network science to biology has advanced our understanding of the metabolisms of individual organisms and the organization of ecosystems, but has scarcely been applied to life at a planetary scale. To characterize planetary-scale biochemistry, I constructed biochemical networks using global databases of annotated genomes and metagenomes, and biochemical reactions. I uncover scaling laws governing biochemical diversity and network structure shared across levels of organization from individuals to ecosystems, to the biosphere as a whole. Comparing real biochemical reaction networks to random reaction networks reveals the observed biological scaling is not a product of chemistry alone, but instead emerges due to the particular structure of selected reactions commonly participating in living processes. I perform distinguishability tests across properties of individual and ecosystem-level biochemical networks to determine whether or not they share common structure, indicative of common generative mechanisms across levels. My results indicate there is no sharp transition in the organization of biochemistry across distinct levels of the biological hierarchy\u2014a result that holds across different network projections.

Parallel Computational Methods for Model-Based Tomographic Reconstruction and Coherent Imaging. Major Professors: Charles A. Bouman, Gregery T. Buzzard. Non-destructive imaging modalities for evaluating the internal properties of materials can be formulated as physics-driven inverse problems. Model-based Iterative reconstruction (MBIR) methods that integrate a forward model of the imaging system and a prior model of the object being imaged can provide superior reconstruction quality relative to conventional methods. However, making MBIR feasible for practical applications faces two key challenges. First, we require efficient computational methods for MBIR that allow large-scale reconstructions in real-time. Second, we must develop forward models that accurately capture the physics and geometry of the imaging system, and, support the use of advanced denoisers that enhance image quality as prior models. This thesis attempts to address the aforementioned challenges and is divided into three main chapters, each corresponding to a different inverse imaging application. In the first chapter of this thesis, we propose a novel 4D model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm for low-angle coherent-scatter X-ray Diffraction (XRD) tomography that can substantially increase the SNR. Our forward model is based on a Poisson photon counting model that incorporates a spatial point-spread function, detector energy response and energy-dependent attenuation correction. Our prior model uses a Markov random field (MRF) together with a reduced spectral bases set determined using non-negative matrix factorization. Our algorithm efficiently computes the Bayesian estimate by exploiting the sparsity of the measurement data. We demonstrate the ability of our method to achieve sufficient spatial resolution", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 1060, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Mathematics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2110247162", "name": "Kyoung-Soo Lee"}]}}, {"citingPaper": {"paperId": "b46b17b69bd13f7d141dc51be0896850c7a4557e", "corpusId": 48357942, "title": "Toward higher-order network models", "abstract": "Complex systems play an essential role in our daily lives.

We attribute the nonstationarity of citation distributions to different longevity of the low-cited and highly cited papers. By measuring citation trajectories of papers we found that citation careers of the low-cited papers come to saturation after 10-15 years while those of the highly cited papers continue to increase indefinitely: The papers that exceed some citation threshold become runaways. Thus, we show that although citation distribution can look as a power-law dependence, it is not scale free and there is a hidden dynamic scale associated with the onset of runaways.

It claims that hierarchical power is sought for its own sake; that building and sustaining this power demands strategic sabotage; and that sabotage absorbs a significant proportion of the energy captured by society.

In the ABM introduced here, the agents\u2019 interactions and participation in sharing their views are dependent on the similarity of the agents\u2019 webs of beliefs; the greater the similarity, the more likely the interaction and sharing of elements of WoBs. In interactions, the WoBs are altered when agents seek consensus and consensus groups are formed. The consensus group formation depends on the agents\u2019 sensitivity to the similarity of their WoBs. If their sensitivity is low, only one large and diffuse group is formed, while with high sensitivity, many separated and segregated consensus groups emerge.
