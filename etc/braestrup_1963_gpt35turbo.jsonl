C. WYNNE-EDWARDS published a paper on low reproductive rates in certain birds. This paper contained important arguments against views expounded with, what appeared to be strict and irrefutable logic, by LACK (e.g. 1954) , viz., that in birds and mammals the number of eggs laid, or young born, corresponds to the largest number of offspring possible to raise. Lack maintains that if, e.g., some individuals in a bird population (on account of hereditary difference), lay more eggs than others, and thus, on an average, leave a greater number of descendants, the result will be an increase of fertility to the point where the parents are unable to procure enough food for the offspring.\n\nIt may be argued and this is the line taken by W.-E.both in the paper mentioned and in the book under reviewthat Lack's view rests on a mistaken notion of natural selection. The process of selection works, not only between individuals, but also between groups and between species, thus promoting characters which are to the benefit of the group, even in the face of contrary individual selection which may be kept in check by special devices. The existence of such evolutionary mechanisms is not only called for by a great many otherwise unaccountable facts, but is also in accordance with genetic evolutionary theory (see e.g. WRIGHT, 1945) .\n\nSince the bulk of what follows will be in a critical vein, it would be as well to begin by stating that on this main point I am in perfect accordance with Wynne-Edwards. In fact, about 10 years ago, I wrote some books for Scandinavian readers (1952, 1953, and 1954) in which the importance of intergroup selection in connection with many points concerning social adaptation were stressed. 0. KALELA, who was concerned with the same problems, wrote, simultanously, notes which were still less accessible to most biologists owing to the fact they were written in Finnish. However, in 1954 he finally published a paper in German which, I think, is up to now one of the best introductions to the topic. It may be recommended in cases where critical readers of Wynne-Edwards' book, with little previous knowledge of vertebrate \"socio-ecology\", have been so scared by wild or even absurd theories that they are inclined to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\nAmong biologists who have laid the foundation for the notion of auto-regulating mechanisms, it is easy for Scandinavians to remember our good friend P. L. ERRING-TON, who has again and again, especially in connection with his life-long work on the muskratstressed the decisive influence of the mutual tolerance or aggression of the animals themselves, in regulating numbers. His work is only casually mentioned by W.-E. On the whole, considering the enormous size of the book and the many rather peripheral topics treated, it is surprising how incompletely the really pertinent points are reviewed. I think it may be said of the book, with a certain amount of truth, that most of what is sound in it is not new, and most of which is new is not sound. This in itself might not have been a very serious objection. If it had contained a good, well-digested, and balanced summary of facts and views on animals density regulation in relation to social behaviour, together with a clear statement of the problems (and on this foundation a statement of the more extreme theories of the author), it might have been a highly useful book.\n\nInstead, it is propagandistic with all the evil consequences of misplaced enthusiasm. It may of course be read in a leisurely way for the sake of the many interesting details given, but the reader who is eager to discover what exactly the author's theories are, and what evidence he uses to base them on, will find himself frustrated and irritated long before he is through with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"paragraphs\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 1955 V.

The author goes on to say that in general the same applies as forcibly to herbivores as to carnivores. Now, while this may of course, be broadly true, civilized man's exploitation by means of highly perfected mechanical devices has, on the other hand, certain peculiar traits.

The role of territoriality in imposing a ceiling on population density is now generally admitted, especially in cases where food for the individual (or pair) in possession is wholly or to a large extent found in the territory.

Good evidence for true hierarchies in lower vertebrates and in invertebrates is meagre. Nevertheless, the author is at considerable pains to push the beginning of competition for conventional goals very far back in the animal kingdom. It is his theory that \"it is precisely in this ... that social organisation and the primitive seeds of all social behaviour have their origin\", \". . . a society can be defined for our purposes as an organisation capable of providing conventional competition: this, at least, appears to be its original, most primitive function, which indeed survives more or less thinly veiled even in the civilised societies of man. The social organisation is originally set up, therefore, to provide the feed-back for the homeostatic machine\" (p. 14).\n\nThe author seems to have arrived at this highly improbable conclusion by a deplorable propensity to include very different phenomena under the same heading. At least, he often fails to take account of very deep seated dissimilarities. For instance, the follow-my-leader reaction of the processionary caterpillars is mentioned as an example of (inborn) conventional behaviour (p. 449), and on p. 127 we find the following sentences: \"the barnacle larva which at metamorphosis fixes itself or is inhibited from doing so, depending on the presence and number of other barnacle larvae already attached, is responding socially in a way that is not effectively different in principle from the one which animates the communal behaviour of the social insects or the most highly socialised birds and mammals. In each case the behaviour of the individual is conditioned by the presence and actions of other members of the population in the interests of regulating the dispersion of the group as a whole.'\"\n\nThe fact that large tadpoles produce substances that powerfully inhibit or arrest the growth of small tadpoles (p. 558) is highly interesting as a 'homeostatic mechanism', but, as far as one can see, it has nothing to do with 'conventional competition'. The same may be said of most of the well-attested cases of auto-regulation in animals other than birds and mammals.\n\nSome of the best evidence comes from experiments with guppies (Lebistes). If a colony is started in a tank containing a certain amount of water and with ample food, the final population (biomass) will always be of the same size (about 32 grams fish in 17 litres of water). If too many adults were added, some of them died for unknown reasons \"without symptom of disease, injury, or other tangible effect\" (BREDER and COATES, 1932, p. 149) , and if, e. g., a single female was added in, the young were devoured after the limit was reached.

Among the examples mentioned we find, somewhat surprisingly, bees of the genus Halictus, of which there are many very similar species (some of them show beginnings of sociality, but this seems immaterial in the present connection). Sometimes very similar species nest together. It is apparently forgotten that in these bees an egg is never laid until food has been gathered for the larva in question, and furthermore the resources, honey and pollen, are not easily depleted, so here additional regulating mechanisms seem quite unnecessary.\n\nThe author starts off these sections with an account of interspecific territoriality in birds, and in this way he endeavours to pave a less forbidding path to the rather hazardous theories which follow. Some semantic obscurities are also involved. I am certainly not, of course, accusing the author of intentionally confusing the issue. He is obviously honest in his endeavours to persuade the reader of the truth as he sees it. But it is a fact that the ambiguous use (in these and some other chapters) of the terms 'dispersion' and 'dispersive' tends to make it easier for the reader to swallow certain theories which with more exact presentation he would have left alone.\n\nThe term dispersion has been borrowed from LACK (1954, p. 264) where it means the non-random type of distribution of a species (of birds in particular) within suitable habitats. As a rule, it is easy to see that individuals are dispersed in an appropriate way with respect to food-supply, and Lack himself was in some doubt as to how this was brought about. Obviously there is some involvement here of the habitat selection mechanism, i.e. the mechanism that leads populations into the habitat where, in the long run, they are able to compete. It may even be impossible to make a clear-cut division between these concepts, but the emphasis is somewhat different. This is not discussed in the book. W.-E. merely writes (p. 1) that dispersion may be defined to include habitat selection. There is no review of present knowledge of habitat selection, e.g. in birds. This is rather unimportant, however, in comparison with the failure in some sections of the book, to distinguish between dispersion and regulation of (total) numbers. This looseness of usage is already inherent in the title of the book (which is in fact concerned with the entire problem of numbers) and in the expression 'the dispersion hypothesis' or 'the theory of dispersion' (e.g. p. 21) pertaining to the author's (or Carr-Saunders') views. On p. 49 we read of \"dispersive responses, either by immediate movement of individuals, or by delayed action on recruitment rate\". A few lines previous to this (p. 48), it is said of an 'epideictic display' that it is \"concerned with dispersion and the regulation of numbers\", which seems to imply a distinction between these concepts.

Sometimes very similar species nest together. It is apparently forgotten that in these bees an egg is never laid until food has been gathered for the larva in question, and furthermore the resources, honey and pollen, are not easily depleted, so here additional regulating mechanisms seem quite unnecessary.\",\n      \"sentiment_score\": 6,\n      \"mentions_or_references\": [\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Vespula\",\n          \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n          \"author_view\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"text\": \"Halictus\",\n          \"sentiment_score\": 7,\n          \"author_view\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"equation\": \"sentiment_score = 6 + (5 + 7) / 2 * 0.2\",\n      \"model\": \"linear\",\n      \"author_view\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The author starts off these sections with an account of interspecific territoriality in birds, and in this way he endeavours to pave a less forbidding path to the rather hazardous theories which follow.

He is obviously honest in his endeavours to persuade the reader of the truth as he sees it.

As a rule, it is easy to see that individuals are dispersed in an appropriate way with respect to food-supply, and Lack himself was in some doubt as to how this was brought about. Obviously there is some involvement here of the habitat selection mechanism, i.e. the mechanism that leads populations into the habitat where, in the long run, they are able to compete. It may even be impossible to make a clear-cut division between these concepts, but the emphasis is somewhat different. This is not discussed in the book. W.-E. merely writes (p. 1) that dispersion may be defined to include habitat selection. There is no review of present knowledge of habitat selection, e.g. in birds. This is rather unimportant, however, in comparison with the failure in some sections of the book, to distinguish between dispersion and regulation of (total) numbers. This looseness of usage is already inherent in the title of the book (which is in fact concerned with the entire problem of numbers) and in the expression 'the dispersion hypothesis' or 'the theory of dispersion' (e.g. p. 21) pertaining to the author's (or Carr-Saunders') views. On p. 49 we read of \\\"dispersive responses, either by immediate movement of individuals, or by delayed action on recruitment rate\\\". A few lines previous to this (p. 48), it is said of an 'epideictic display' that it is \\\"concerned with dispersion and the regulation of numbers\\\", which seems to imply a distinction between these concepts.
