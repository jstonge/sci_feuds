Thus, Lack (45) and Williams (77) argued that selection at the individual level is sufficient to explain evolutionary adaptation. Although biologists have generally tended to agree (e. g. 51), evolution by differential extinction of groups has recently been modelled or discussed anew by several authors (11, 18,21,28, 30, 32, 39,48,49, 51, 53, 55, 79-82, 84, 85) .

While it is commonly asserted that selection operates chiefly at the individual level, it is also obvious that the genetic composition of individuals disintegrates during sexual reproduction and that the identifi able heritable units that reconstitute in descen-dants represent only fragments of the original genotype. Franklin & Lewontin (27) emphasized what Ford (25) , Sheppard (61), Mayr (56, 57), and other ecological geneticists had long argued-that units larger than genes are regularly transferred from one generation to the next and that therefore heritability is high fo r such linkage groups or \"genetic chunks\" (52; see also 63).

Approaches to these questions have most often taken the fo rm of modelling the population structure seemingly most conducive to group selection, then seeking that structure in nature. Additionally, most authors writing on this topic have restricted themselves largely to groups distinct from one another only because of habitat patchiness, as opposed to groups resulting from other circumstances that favor group living (2) . Lewontin (51) in a somewhat different approach sought reasons fo r different intensities of selection in the properties of units at different levels in the hierarchy of organization of life, and noted that rapidity of response to selection depends upon heritability, variation, and the rates of reproduction and mortality per unit time. He concluded that \"the primary focus of evolution by natural selection is the individual.\" The change in Lewontin's thinking about selection at individual and group levels between 1965 and 1970, paralleling that of most evolutionary biologists, can be illustrated by this quotation from his 1965 paper [(50) , p. 309]:\n\nBy all odds the most important cases of interdeme selection are those in which the character that increases the probability of survival of the deme as a unit is itself being selected against within the population .... A striking one is selection of feeding pressure in an herbivore. Clearly, within a population the animal that gets the most food with the least effort is selected for, yet the end result of such selection pressure would be a population of super herbivores who would rapidly deplete the vegetation and cause extinction of the population as a whole. Only interdeme selection, it would seem, could hold down the rate of food consumption in the species.\n\nIn 1970 he analyzed precisely the same circumstance in quite different terms [(51), p. 13], concluding that \"self-regulation of numbers, on which most ofthe argument for group selection is built, simply does not occur.\"\n\nRecent analyses of group selection have taken three fo rms. First are attempts to explain apparent cases in nature, of which two remain problematical (5 1). Second are efforts to model population structure conducive to group selection. Third are experiments demonstrating conditions under which group selection is effective (7 1).\n\nLewontin [(51), pp. 14-15] notes that, \"although ... we do not need population selection to explain evolution [and] ... in most instances it would be an inefficient process, there is still the possibility ... [and] in fact [there are] two well-documented cases of interdeme selection ... [these being] evolution of the \"t\" gene in Mus musculus . . .

32, 49, 53, 79, 81) . Characteristically these models assume the most favorable conditions fo r group selection. Thus, the rates of repro duction and mortality of popUlations are reduced to near those of individuals--e.g. by assuming that habitats last only one or a fe w generations. The likelihood of relevant heritable differences between groups is sometimes maximized by / assuming replacement of extinct groups, or filling of empty habitat, randomly across the population rather than by neighboring populations (e.g. 79). If populations do not break up and reform frequently, then individual and genic selection within groups will tend to eliminate altruism among fo unding individuals; if fo unding individuals tend to locate near their natal popUlations, then neighboring groups will be similar and less likely to be differentially extinguished owing to their trait differences. Unless differential extinction of groups (or differential production of migrants by them) correlates with trait differences, group selection cannot occur, although individually deleterious traits could be fi xed by drift (87) . In many cases these recent models also assume very small subpopulations or groups, which reduces the proportion of the total genetic variance contained in each group, thus also enhancing the likelihood of heritable differences between groups (e.g. 53). In some cases they assume a high degree of population viscosity, with or without actual fo rmation of subpopulations (e.g. 39). In some cases small subpopu lations are assumed to form as a result of a few fe males' depositing all of their young in an empty habitat (79) . These kinds of assumptions are fo rced on group-selection theorists: In order to get models that work they must have situations in which supposedly altruistic traits benefit other individuals also carrying the alleles that lead to altruism. In other words, if social interactants are sufficiently likely to be genetic kin, then genes leading their bearers to altruism will spread by kin selection and the inclusive fitness of the bearers will be raised. Accordingly, the relevant selection is returned to individual and gene levels, and models with this feature are not models of group selection. Consistent with these arguments, in some models individuals are also postulated to \"assort positively\" with their \"own type in settling from the migrant cloud\" [(39), p. 139). Hamilton (39) thus considers an inclusive-fitness model \"more general than the 'group selection,' 'kin selection,' or 'reciprocal altru ism' approaches\" because it \"can deal with an ungrouped viscous population where, owing to restricted migration, an individual's normal neighbors and interactants tend to be his genetical kindred.\" One of the reasons Hamilton believes his model is able to deal with this situation is that \"it obviously makes no difference if altruists settle with altruists because they are related (perhaps never having parted from them) or because they recognize fe llow altruists as such, or settle together because of some pleiotropic effect of the gene on habitat preference.\" However, genes for the same habitat preference as altruists, but no altruism, would replace those leading to both altruism and habitat preference. For this and other reasons, detailed later, we are skeptical of some of the proximate mechanisms for altruism among kin suggested in this model. As we will also argue later, an inclusive-fitness model depending upon nondiscriminative altruism among individuals who are more or less symmetrical in their ability to provide social benefits may not be very general.

net effect is beneficial to their possessors (53, 82) , meaning that they raise their possessors' inclusive fitness in the population at large. Such traits are not altruistic in the usual biological sense, and models proposed for their spread need not involve group selection (16, 67 \n\nGroup selection is commonly regarded as a problem involving the relative potencies of selection at the two levels of the individual and the social group or population. Individuals cooperate in social, economic, political, and kin groups, and these various groups may form coalitions at still higher levels. Life, however, is organized not in a two-ranked hierarchy but in a many-ranked one. Thus, genes fu nction in groups called chromosomes, and chromosomes in groups called genomes, and these merge into hierarchies of individuals, demes, populations, species, communities, and ecosystems. Interactions among subunits within a genome may parallel the interac tions of individuals or coalitions within social groups. By comparing the operation of selection at different levels in the hierarchy, we may better understand how differential reproduction has produced the current structures and organization of living systems. Traditional arguments concerned with group selection have fo cused on interactions among individuals to produce group effects. Under what we call an expanded view of group selection, interactions among entities at all levels in the hierarchy of living systems may be considered in terms of their contribution to patterns of reproduction. Long-continued potent selection at any level in the hierar chy of life is likely to enhance the integrity of entities at that level and reduce the likelihood of conflicts of interest with units at lower levels. This effect of selection may be responsible fo r many of the commonplace concepts of biology: gene, chromosome, individual, and family; and in some sense it lies behind the identifica tion of cohesive fu nctional elements such as tissues and organs, various appendages, refl exes, and refl ex groups, and of individuality in behavioral acts. The complexities involved in extending the concept of group selection to include the interactions of subgenomic genetic units, and the value of this procedure, are illustrated by Lewon tin's 1974 conclusion [(52), p. 307], in a chapter entitled \"The genome as unit of selection,\" that \"relative selective values of substitution at a locus cannot be judged from the frequencies of the alleles in nature because the selection of the chromosome as a whole is the overriding determinant of allelic fr equencies. \" (Italics in original.)\n\nSome constituents in the hierarchy of organization of life evidently owe their identity not so much to their status as selective units as to externally imposed selective fo rces such as habitat patchiness and the vagaries of climate and weather. Species, for example, almost certainly fo rm as a result of genic and individual selection. Never theless, as Hamilton (37) noted, group (interpopulational or interdemic) selection within species may be a more precarious concept than group selection between species; the reason is that reproductive isolation between species negates the require ment of an unlikely intraspecific population structure fo r intraspecific group selec tion. Thus, species can co-exist, \"poised\" to replace one another, without losing their differences through amalgamation. Indeed, they can continue to diverge, and they can even cause one another's extinction. One implication is that while ecological communities may often be significantly affected by differential extinction of species, species are not necessarily likely to have been greatly influenced by differential extinction of populations or demes (see 81) . Another is that conspecific populations that behave toward one another as if they were different species-maintaining separate territories, discouraging movement of individuals between groups, display ing intergroup aggression, and especially showing efforts to extinguish and replace one another-are thereby enhancing the likelihood of significant group selection, or indicating its importance in their past."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"sentences\": [\n        {\n            \"text\": \"In some recent models for the evolution of altruism, traits that involve social acts benefiting others are regarded as altruistic even when their net effect is beneficial to their possessors (53, 82), meaning that they raise their possessors' inclusive fitness in the population at large.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 6,\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"text\": \"(53, 82)\",\n                    \"sentiment_score\": 6,\n                    \"opposing\": false,\n                    \"author_view\": false\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Such traits are not altruistic in the usual biological sense, and models proposed for their spread need not involve group selection (16, 67).\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 4,\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"text\": \"(16, 67)\",\n                    \"sentiment_score\": 4,\n                    \"opposing\": false,\n                    \"author_view\": false\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Group selection is commonly regarded as a problem involving the relative potencies of selection at the two levels of the individual and the social group or population.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Individuals cooperate in social, economic, political, and kin groups, and these various groups may form coalitions at still higher levels.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Life, however, is organized not in a two-ranked hierarchy but in a many-ranked one.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Thus, genes function in groups called chromosomes, and chromosomes in groups called genomes, and these merge into hierarchies of individuals, demes, populations, species, communities, and ecosystems.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 7,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Interactions among subunits within a genome may parallel the interactions of individuals or coalitions within social groups.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"By comparing the operation of selection at different levels in the hierarchy, we may better understand how differential reproduction has produced the current structures and organization of living systems.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 6,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Traditional arguments concerned with group selection have focused on interactions among individuals to produce group effects.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Under what we call an expanded view of group selection, interactions among entities at all levels in the hierarchy of living systems may be considered in terms of their contribution to patterns of reproduction.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 7,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Long-continued potent selection at any level in the hierarchy of life is likely to enhance the integrity of entities at that level and reduce the likelihood of conflicts of interest with units at lower levels.\",\n            \"sentiment_score\": 7,\n            \"references\": [],\n            \"author_view\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"This effect of selection may be responsible for many of the commonplace concepts of biology: gene, chromosome, individual, and family;

Recent investigators seem to agree that Fisher's arguments about the evolution of sexuality are unsupportable because of the way in which they invoke selection at the population or species level (e.g. 54, 78). But when a sexual population produces an asexual one-when a sexual individual asexually produces an offspring capable of continuing to reproduce asexually-unless the asexual de scendants can revert more or less easily to sexuality, the asexual population is exactly like a second species, and the competition between sexuality and asexuality (that is, the question whether or not sexuality is maintained) is in some sense between the asexual genotype (throughout the asexual population except fo r muta tions) and the whole collection of recombining sexual genotypes. This is as clearly group selection as is competition between two distinct species. Williams [(78), p. 110] invokes this kind of selection as a partial explanation for the maintenance of sexuality in low-fecundity populations, as Fisher had invoked it long before by comparing the relative rates at which beneficial mutations can spread through competing sexual and asexual populations.\n\nPart of the reason fo r considering the whole collection of genotypes in the sexual population in the above argument is that, in comparing sexual and asexual geno types as competitors, one cannot measure simply the collective value of a brood in the sexual line to determine the fitness of the parent. Also involved is how different is the average fitness of the brood members from the rest of the population---o r, more specifically, from that of potential mates. A set of offspring enormously superior to the asexual genotype(s) might, on this account, be limited to producing a set of grandchildren inferior to the asexual genotype(s). This is a hazard of specialized sex (meaning loss of the ability to become quickly asexual when a superior genotype is produced, or when fitness is high and the environment is stable), and to some extent it binds together the members of a sexual population and gives special importance to the average fitness of sexual genotypes. The average fitness of genotypes in sexual populations, despite its wide use in population genetics, actually has little significance, except in interspecific competition that is definitely leading to unilateral extinction, or when there are asexual genotypes with which to compete. If there are no asexual genotypes, then, unless fitness differences involve some kind of \"absolute\" values (i.e., unless they refer to differential survival rather than differ ential reproduction), the variance in (heritable) fitness will determine the rate of evolution (24) . Situations involving the above \"absolute\" and \"relative\" fitness values correspond roughly to Wallace's (72) \"hard\" and \"soft\" selection, which he used to explain why genetic load is a misleading concept when it involves arithmetic which implies that the fitness of any polymorphic population is lowered because of the \"genetic deaths\" that result from heterozygote advantage (segregational load) or that are necessary to remove the deleterious allele by selection (substitutional load) (see also 12, 13) . If there are competing asexual genotypes, however, the fittest sexual genotypes will be hurt in their competition with the asexual genotypes by having only inferior genotypes with which to recombine. One way out of the dilemma is selective mating. If phenotypes produced by superior genotypes are able to restrict their matings to other superior genotypes they need not be dragged down all the way by the average fitness of the entire sexual population. Selective mating, however, increases the cost of sexuality.\n\nThus, Fisher's argument would have been appropriate had he applied it to the maintenance of sexuality rather than to its origin-in other words, ifhe had assumed that sexuality was the primitive condition and had referred only to fo rms in which asexual lines are generated from sexual lines, without the ability to change with facility between sexuality and asexuality."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"paragraphs\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"From this perspective we may reconsider Fisher's (24) view of the selective

We tend to view only alternative alleles as competi tors. Even genes at different loci, however, are potentially reproductively competing entities, at least historically, and in this sense genes in genomes may be viewed as parallels to individuals in populations. At infrequent intervals, the genes in sexual genomes disperse and recombine, fo rming new genomes in a fashion roughly parallel to the dispersal and recombination of individuals in species living in temporary habitats. The regularity and organization of the periodic recombinations of genes in genomes, and the complexity of genic cooperation between recombinations that produces the emergent populational effect that we call the phenotype, may at first cause this comparison with individuals to seem bizarre. Unlike individuals in spe cies, genes in genomes (usually) cooperate without differential reproduction and it is this cooperation that contributes to our view of an individual as a well-defined unit in the reproductive hierarchy. At any time, however, sexual genomes are susceptible to the appearance of genes or other units (here termed \"outlaw\" genes or units) that, because of recombination, may reproduce at some expense to the rest of the genome. effects deleterious to the rest of the genome will be favored fo r that suppression; in a later section we describe systems that seem to produce this type of control.\n\nUnlike the populations of genes that make up sexual genotypes, those in com pletely asexual (apomictic) genotypes never recombine; hence, the genome is cer tainly the unit of selection. Changing any gene creates a new genotype, and the fate of every gene is inextricably linked to the fates of all other genes in its genotype. The interests of the genes within an asexual genotype are evidently synonymous, meaning that they scarcely (if at all) compete with other genes in their own geno types; they compete only with those in other genotypes. (In this sense the apomictic genotype is fu nctionally a gene.) That asexuality appears usually to be secondary increases the evident appropriateness of viewing asexual genotypes as products of a history of group selection.\n\nIn some sense, then, it can be seen that all units of higher levels in the hierarchy of organization of life are essentially aspects of the environments in which units at lower levels are selected.

Such an allele will be an outlaw not in its own genome but within its brood and in terms of the parental genome. The allele, therefore, must not only overcome any suppressing effects by the parent, which may be quite powerful (2), but must also compete with its alternatives both in lines not containing it and in mixed broods.\n\nSupport for the existence of selection against \"outlaws\" is provided by reports that, in some dipteran females, aberrant chromosomes are preferentially shunted into polar bodies during meiosis (15, 65) . In humans, only one of the X chromo somes is active in somatic cells; if one X chromosome is damaged it generally becomes the deactivated member of the pair (26, 31, 34) .\n\nGenes on the Y chromosome are particularly likely to be able to operate to their own advantage, contrary to the interests of other genes in their own genome (37) . Because this chromosome occurs only in the heterogametic sex, and alone is passed intact through generations of descendants of that sex, the possibility exists for genes on it to mutate and cause their bearers to fa vor descendants carrying the mutation (40) . Any effects of genes on any chromosome that increase the phenotypic distinc tiveness of the sexes would incidentally increase the potential for a Y mutant to produce this effect. Such a gene might cause its bearer to give more care to descen dants of the same sex, or to give care only to descendants of that sex; or it might cause the bearer to produce only offspring of the same sex. Any such gene would be approximately three times as effective as similar genes on the other (X) sex chromosome, because each X chromosome spends approximately one third of its time in the heterogametic sex (37) , and in humans even more so because of the recognizability of the Y chromosome, given established cultural inheritance patterns [e.g. males may pass inheritance directly to grandsons or great-grandsons through all-male lines of descendants (40) ].\n\nIf the above arguments about outlawry are correct, effects of genes on the Y chromosome might be expected to lead to a general suppression of their activity by modifiers throughout the genome, thus contributing to the observed general inert ness of the Y chromosome. Hamilton (37) attributed this general inertness to the genomic response to Y mutants when they cause either meiotic drive or differential success of V-bearing sperm. The effect postulated here refers to fa voring of Y bearing zygotes; it is likely more restricted than that postulated by Hamilton because it would only be effective when descendants beyond first-generation offspring can be assisted (since first-generation offspring carrying the male's X chromosome can also be positively identified)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"analysis\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Some alleles that cause an offspring to gain at its parent's expense may be able to spread.\",\n      \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n      \"mentions\": [],\n      \"equation\": \"none\",\n      \"model\": \"none\",\n      \"author_view\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The allele, therefore, must not only overcome any suppressing effects by the parent, which may be quite powerful, but must also compete with its alternatives both in lines not containing it and in mixed broods.\",\n      \"sentiment_score\": 2,\n      \"mentions\": [],\n      \"equation\": \"none\",\n      \"model\": \"none\",\n      \"author_view\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Support for the existence of selection against 'outlaws' is provided by reports that, in some dipteran females, aberrant chromosomes are preferentially shunted into polar bodies during meiosis.\",\n      \"sentiment_score\": 7,\n      \"mentions\": [\n        {\n          \"mention\": \"reports\",\n          \"sentiment_score\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"mention\": \"dipteran females\",\n          \"sentiment_score\": 7\n        }\n      ],\n      \"equation\": \"none\",\n      \"model\": \"none\",\n      \"author_view\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In humans, only one of the X chromosomes is active in somatic cells;

Driving X chromosomes in populations of this species differentiate into two types, northern and southern, based on their response to control by Y chromosomes. Northern X loses its capability to drive when paired with southern Y; when an X is paired with a Y from its own locality there is no inhibition of drive. Northern Y does not suppress drive in either X. Additionally, an autosomal trait suppresses drive in both types of X. Alleles involved in suppress ing chromosomal drive apparently also exist in some populations of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti (42), and Hamilton (37) discusses suppression of driving chromo somes by other elements in the genome.\n\nSelection against differential success ofY-bearing sperm or zygotes could feasibly have contributed to the disappearance of the Y chromosome in many insects. Thus, the general evolutionary sequence leading to the haplodiploid insects might have been the fo llowing: 1. establishment of separate sex chromosomes, with the male XV; 2. modification of the Y chromosome to a generally inert condition; 3. loss of the Y chromosome, leaving females with all of the genetic materials necessary to make sons; 4. production of haploid sons parthenogenetically [or, as in some aphids, diploid sons by a meiotic parthenogenetic process in which only an X chromosome is eliminated via the polar body, creating the XO male genotype (58)]. Loss of the Y chromosome in the ancestor of haplodiploid insects, with its peculiar short-term advantages, thus apparently led to the males of haplodiploid species now being unable to produce sons at all, having lost this particular battle of the sexes because in their ancestors part of the male genome behaved contrarily to the interests of the more powerful remainder.\n\nDriving effects most certainly occur in the homogametic sex and in autosomes, but they should be less apparent there, largely because they would not lead to sex ratio distortions. A driving autosome would either replace its homolog or be sup pressed by modifiers, most likely on the homolog. Considerations of these sorts, however, lead to the suggestion that whatever symmetry exists in the events of mitosis and meiosis may be largely the result of stalemates between competitive elements in the genome.\n\nAs with generalized responses to outlawry by individuals living in social groups (e.g. legislation against predictable classes of disruptive behavior such as murder or usury), generalized responses to deleterious mutants (whether or not the mutant contributes to its own reproduction at the expense of the genotype as a whole) would have the additional advantage to the group as a whole (here, the group of genes) of providing a means of avoiding disasters, or of capitalizing on opportunities that are individually unique but fall within the class protected by the \"law\" or the \"repair\" (or maintenance) mechanism. The response would evolve as a result of recurring past deviations (e.g. murders or mutations) and would be maintained because of its value in dealing with continuing deviations; thus, it could prevent an \"outlaw\" gene from spreading at all.\n\nThus, we may raise the question whether the evolution of dominance and reces siveness of allelic effects by selection of modifi ers at other loci (24) could evolve to be expressed as a generalized resistance to dominance in mutants, or whether it is strictly a genic effect, with specific modifiers affecting each allele. The possibility of generalized response counters the criticisms of Fisher's theory of dominance modifi cation that second-or third-order modification would be weak and genetically expensive, and would only be favored during brief transitory periods of heterozygosity (e.g. 17).

Unless they have been retained because of specific effects on particular molecules, such mechanisms are likely to be polygenic and they may often be the result of selection maintaining the genetic status quo at the level of the genome or very large subunits within it. Similarly, immune responses that are so complex or so generalized that they are commonly described as involving the recognition of \"foreignness\" may effectively bar outlawry as a result of either growth of mutant tissues or viral invasion (10) .\n\nDemonstrations that undirected altruistic tendencies would spread in viscous popu lations if individuals tended to interact with close relatives have led to implications that (a) sociality commonly grows from acts of undirected altruism that are faintly beneficial to the inclusive fitness of the actor because of slight incidental numerical fa voring of individuals with the same trait, and (b) that altruism directed equally to any interactant is a simpler, more likely primitive condition, or a more parsimoni ous assumption, than is altruism directed only to certain closely related interactants. Thus, Hamilton (39) regards the basic problem of achieving a suitable frequency of altruism in a viscous population as similar to that of spreading a powerfully kin selected mutant. This might be true if there were no preexisting situations involving powerful kin selection, or if alleles leading to discriminative nepotism could be kept out of the population. Powerful kin selection is universal among sexual organisms in the fo rm of mater nal investment in eggs and offspring. A mutant causing its bearer to assist only its own juvenile offspring has a 50% likelihood of helping itself, which is an enormous advantage at the outset; and it is most likely to represent aid with potent returns because (a) juveniles are so easily assisted by parents, (b) parents (in sexual species) usually have several or many offspring they might assist, and (c) few parents are precisely adapted to predictable environments; most have some opportunity to contribute to offspring survival with remainders of reproductive effort that would otherwise be lost.\n\nIn higher animals, complex sociality is concentrated in highly parental organisms and tightly knit sibling groups; it may be restricted to them. Such circumstances place together the most closely related individuals of a species in terms of genes identical by descent. In the parent-offspring interaction, moreover, the two kinds of individuals are maximally asymmetrical in age, stage, vulnerability to mortality from predators and climate, and overlap of resource use. Accordingly, parents (adults) are in a maximally favorable position to dispense inexpensive aid to off spring (eggs) that maximally resemble the parents genetically. The ubiquity of varying extents of parental investment across the animal and plant kingdoms sup ports the argument that the parent-offspring interaction is the major source of social donorism or phenotypic altruism. Except for sibling groups [e.g. (24) , p. 177-78] we know of no cases in which altruism seems likely to have originated between individuals of like age and stage, which therefore lack the asymmetry of competitive ness and inexpensive aid that characterizes the parent-offspring interaction.

S. Wilson and Hamilton, and also implied in the arguments of authors who tend to merge kin selection and group selection (e.g. 84), except as a likely outgrowth of within-family or directed nepotism.\n\nContrasting directed and undirected altruism suggests either more likely to be derivatives than forerunners of powerful kin selection in contexts like parental assistance to offspring or cooperation between siblings. As Hamilton's [(35) , p. 24] second generalization suggests, undirected altruism would tend to be replaced by directed nepotism because the latter, as soon as it appears, renders the fo rmer an inferior alternative. Once altruism had evolved, however, from, say, parent-offspring or sibling interactions, situations would arise in which ability to practice nepotism discriminately had not been evolved, but in which altruism was elicited in a nondiscriminative fashion.\n\nA complicating factor, for understanding sociality in groups of individuals of only slightly closer than average relatedness, is that even the most strictly \"selfish\" herd (38) may, erroneously as well as accurately, give the appearance of involving mild or diffuse undirected altruism. Thus, if one individual tolerates another's presence, it may be difficult for an observer to know whether the first or the second individual is receiving the benefi ts (e.g. see 16) .\n\nHamilton's (35) model of inclusive fitness does not require that nepotists recognize genetic relationships of potential beneficiaries, despite his argument that \"the social behaviour of a species evolves in such a way that in each distinct behaviour-evoking situation the individual will seem to value his neighbor's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship peculiar to that situation.\" The solution to this seeming paradox can be understood from the details of human sociality. Mothers who observe the birth of their own children and immediately develop an unmistakable means of recognition directly establish the identity of this particular relative; but all other assumptions of relationship in human societies depend upon circumstantial evidence. We are told who our various relatives are, or we decide on the basis of various kinds of responses to them by others. Thus, one's putative siblings may be identified as those individuals who are cared fo r by the same adult female, and a man's putative offspring are those individuals accepted by the woman with whom he has been living. Even so, humans could scarcely have been aware, before the advent of modem genetics, of the precise or probable fractional relation ships of supposed genetic relatives. To the extent that they have behaved appropri ately to the various relationships, it is because stable social relationships have paralleled genetic relationships, allowing the fo rmer to predict the latter (4, 5) .

If more than one allele infl uences flows of benefits to other individuals, conflicts are certain to arise because potential recipients will not always be genetically identical at all loci involved in the control of benefit distribution. Although an allele at one locus might control the distribution of benefits in a manner that enhances only its own reproduction, other alleles in its genome would gain from neutralizing this control, and mere numerical superiority should be sufficient to tip the balance in their fa vor.\n\nPatterns of benefit distribution in populations do not correspond to those expected if genetic-recognition systems were common. Studies on human populations (4), ground squirrels (62), prairie dogs (43) , and wasps (59) indicate that closer relatives are treated preferentially. By contrast, fixation fo r \"genetic recognition\" alleles would lead to rather uniform distribution of benefits to all interactants, and relatives would be preferred only while such traits were on their way to fixation. Such systems could account fo r variations in nepotistic behavior associated with social structure only if there is (a) rapid recurrence of mutations leading to genetic recognition or (b) common association with disadvantageous characters through either pleiotropy or linkage. The first condition is unlikely because of the necessity of complex recognition mechanisms, and there is no reason to expect the second.\n\nDependence ofthe classical inclusive fitness model (35) on social behavior appro priate to genetic relationships explains the success of transfers of young of different broods into the broods of adults unrelated to them, and the appearance of parental ability to discriminate among offspring at the time when offspring commonly become mixed in nature (44) .\n\nIn the classical model of inclusive fitness there is agreement within the genome in the pattern and degree of aid given to possible recipients. If donorism depends solely on average probability of identity at each locus, then all intragenomic units share the same interests. mechanisms would yield the common patterns of preferential treatment of close relatives and apparent inability to distinguish among relatives of the same class, even though individuals of that class differ in actual proportions of alleles identical to those of the donor.\n\nIf assessment of relatedness is circumstantial rather than direct, then cheating is less likely because (a) behavior that brings an individual benefits from nonrelatives may reduce the likelihood of recognition, thus benefits, from true relatives, and (b) selection will improve the ability of donors to identify appropriate recipients. Thus, parents of potentially cheating offspring will be excluded from sites where mixups may occur, and social relations will be established at times when certainty of genetic relationship is greatest.\n\nIt has been suggested that selection should work to enhance effectiveness of donors in determining relatedness of potential recipients (35, 39) . Even so, kin selection models generally appear to work through the distribution of benefits based on average relatedness of, fo r example, siblings, rather than preferential treatment of individual siblings that happen to have greater relatedness than that of the average sibling. Given apparent limits on the ability of nepotists to detect variance within classes of related individuals we conclude that donors' discriminative abilities com monly fall below the actual variance among relatives within discriminative classes, in terms of genes identical by descent.\n\nPhenotypic cues may sometimes be used to determine relatedness, as with pater nity in humans. This is an extreme case, since a man shares either half or no genes identical by descent with his spouse's offspring; and because of the long human gestation period men share with other male mammals a certain reduced confidence of paternity.

discrimination. No mutant leading to such behavior, however, could invade the system just described. Each new mutant on a supergene for nepotism would reintro duce a significance for discriminatory behavior on the basis of genes identical by immediate descent among interacting relatives. It would do this because at the start its own distribution would be based on immediate descent. This means, paradoxi cally, that mutants causing any departure whatsoever from the kind of inclusive fitness-maximizing behavior just described would, by this particular effect on their phenotypes, render themselves inferior alternatives to their previously existing al leles. The only way in which a supergene fo r nepotism of the sort described could be altered or replaced would be if changes in the cultural environment diminished the tendency of the old supergene to accomplish inclusive-fitness-maximizing, so that a mutant could improve it.\n\nThese arguments show why Hamilton (35) was correct to fo cus his analysis upon relatedness in genes identical by immediate descent, and they point the way to determining how to deal with the questions of genetic overlap from inbreeding and convergence owing to parallel or convergent selection. One needs only to consider the fates of mutants affecting nepotistic behavior. Such mutants represent the means by which the altruism of nepotism generates, increases, and becomes directed with precision. The successive waves of such mutants will always maximize their own spread by treating relatives as if their own likelihood of occurring in the relative depends upon the proportion of genes identical by immediate descent. This is because each new mutant will indeed tend to be present in just those proportions: No better odds will occur.\n\nThe above comparisons suggest a classification of instances of group selection that may lend direction to the kind of theorizing mentioned by E. O. Wilson (86) (see above). The difference between the sexual or asexual genotype as a group and the usual deme of organisms in nature is that the genome is itself an evolved phenomo non while the deme [e.g. the \"trait group\" of D. S. Wilson (79, 80) ] is an effect imposed upon the population of which it is a part by extrinsic ecological contingen cies.

For example, the latter category may include some social groups of humans. Group living in humans (at least today) seems both inevitable and enormously specialized. It is difficult to avoid the specula tion that human individuals, as with genes, long ago began to gain in the reproduc tive race by cooperating to compete. That genes have been at it much longer and have become much more specialized is indicated by the integrity of the individual organism, so overwhelming that philosophers have regarded the individual as the most distinctive entity in the universe. (Chauvinism is probably also involved, since only individuals have evolved the ability to philosophize.) We take completely for granted the evident standoff competition among genes, which usually results in either an even distribution of representatives of the different loci to the genome population during meiosis and mitosis, or else the automatic death or deformity of the resulting individual. In contrast, despite the complexity of organization and patriotic fervor that characterize some human political states and fa mily clans, differential reproduction by the individuals comprising them, and competitive striv ing evidently related to it, remain prominent. Genes in genomes also operate so much more simply, as, perhaps, to make the comparison strained: Genes appear that enhance or thwart effects of other individual genes or groups of genes, and spread if the effect helps themselves even ifit does so only by helping the genotypes in which the new genes occur. But individual humans reflect on the past, predict the fu ture, compare and discuss their deliberations, and make conscious decisions about coop eration, nepotism, ostracism, cheating, and outlawry-all, of course, through the actions of their genotypes in their particular developmental environments. \n\nCommonality of interests leads to group unity and enhances the likelihood or potency of group selection. Refl ecting upon genotypes and human social groups leads one to the speculation that commonality of interests may reach a maximum when the principal \"hostile fo rces\" (in Darwin's sense) result from competition by parallel or similar groups, as with other social groups within the same species or other groups of genes in a population of genes. This might be true because (a) groups of individuals represent an easy way of multiplying appropriate competitive fo rces against other individuals and groups; (b) reproductive competition and overlap of resource utilization cannot diminish among conspecific individuals as they do be tween species as a result of evolutionary divergence; (c) within groups of like individuals, multiplication of interests prevalent throughout the group against the interests of selfish individuals is more possible [see below; (3, 39)]; or (d) groups within species can be fo rmed of closely related individuals competing against more distant relatives.\n\nActions of individuals in obligately group-living species necessarily evolve as compromises exemplified by two hypothetical questions: (a) How can I help myself directly by hel p ing my own p henoty p e and those of genetic relatives, and (b) how can I help myself indirectly by contributing to the unity and p er p etuation of my social grou p ? In human social groups, at least, the picture is further complicated by a third question: (c) How can I help myself and my relatives by fu rthering novel or temporary within-group coalitions that tip

level (I, 2, 3, 84) . First, the human species is composed of competing and essentially hostile groups that have not only behaved toward one another in the manner of different species but have been able quickly to develop enormous differ ences in reproductive and competitive ability because of cultural innovation and its cumulative effects. Second, human groups are uniquely able to plan and act as units, to look ahead, and to carry out purposely actions designed to sustain the group and improve its competitive position, whether through restricting disruptive behavior from within the group or through direct collective action against competing groups. Human groups, in other words, have the organization and fo resight to accomplish the kinds of behavior tacitly, and evidently erroneously, attributed to organisms in general by Wynne-Edwards (88); rather than being the only organism lacking intrinsic ability to regulate their populations, as Wynne-Edwards (89) suggests, humans may actually be the only species possessing such ability. Of course, majori ties, or power groups, prevail in human societies by rendering disadvantageous certain individual behavior that would otherwise be reproductively advantageous; an example is the imposition of socially controlled monogamy, apparently unique to the human species (8) .\n\nRecent legislation in India requiring sterilization of individuals once they have produced a specifi ed number of offspring suggests the counter example: In any case in which the background and success of such a law depend on a conscious desire of a majority of group members to prevent expansion of the population (which was certainly not the case in India), the law would properly be labelled evidence of self-regulation of numbers by the group itself. Human populations obviously possess this capability [see also (2), p. 376]. Such self-regulation operates through the power of the collective to punish selfi shness and reward altruism-hence, to reinforce the interests of a majority of the group or of a power clique. The extent to which such activities represent or promote group selection depends partly on the fates of the members of unsuccessful or threatened groups. If, in one extreme, they disappear without issue, as in the cases of the Tasmanians and Patagonians, then the concept of group selection is appropriate; if they are consistently able to join successful groups without severe detriments to their reproduction, that is, if coalitions are temporary and shifting, then group selection is not indicated.\n\nLearning and culture are commonly viewed merely as systems of evolved plas ticity. The unique adaptive signifi cance of culture, however, may be that in sexually recombining organisms it can be simultaneously more heritable than genes and more abruptly changeable. Thus, wealth and power may be acquired suddenly, but they may also be more easily passed to the next generation than the phenotypes necessary to acquire them. To the extent it derives from traditionally transmitted learning, culture can also change cumulatively in the absence o f genetic change. Moreover, whether culture is conservative or revolutionary can be determined by immediate contingencies; culture, to a greater degree than learning in general, incorporates the feedback between need and novelty that the genes seem never to have evolved in regard to rates and directions of mutational changes. All aspects of phenotypes illustrate this fe edback to a lesser degree than does culture.
