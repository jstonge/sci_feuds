The gene began to be treated as the sole unit of selection, with arguments at genotypic or higher levels seen as imperfect, holistic, or unnecessarily complicated. On the other hand, unsupportable holism also persisted. Thus, in a book concerned with sex and evolution, Ghiselin (30) scarcely mentioned subgenotypic units of any kind.",

Generally, the question has been asked only in relation to populations and individuals, often in efforts to understand cooperative or altruistic social behavior. Thus, Lack (45) and Williams (77) argued that selection at the individual level is sufficient to explain evolutionary adaptation. Although biologists have generally tended to agree (e. g. 51), evolution by differential extinction of groups has recently been modeled or discussed anew by several authors (11, 18,21,28, 30, 32, 39,48,49, 51, 53, 55, 79-82, 84, 85). E. O. Wilson (86) , for example, has argued that \"In the past several years a real theory of interpopulation selection has begun to be forged, with both enriched premises and rigorous model building .... Insofar as the new theory considers the results of counteraction between group and individual selection, it will produce complex, nonobvious results that constitute testable alternatives to the hypothesis of individual selection. My own intuitive feeling is that interpopulation selection is important in special cases .... \"",

While it is commonly asserted that selection operates chiefly at the individual level, it is also obvious that the genetic composition of individuals disintegrates during sexual reproduction and that the identifiable heritable units that reconstitute in descendants represent only fragments of the original genotype. Franklin & Lewontin (27) emphasized what Ford (25) , Sheppard (61), Mayr (56, 57), and other ecological geneticists had long argued-that units larger than genes are regularly transferred from one generation to the next and that therefore heritability is high for such linkage groups or \"genetic chunks\" (52; see also 63). Mayr (56) and Williams (77) followed Fisher (24) and Haldane (33) in emphasizing the importance of the genetic environment in the effects of selection on gene frequencies.",

Sometimes there may be no significant loss of predictive ability in treating genes as if selection acted directly upon them. In other cases the resulting predictions may be inadequate, as when the interests of the individual gene conflict with those of the rest of the genome in which it resides. The imperfect state of our analyses of these points is revealed by the absence, to now, of any discussion of the sense in which frequencies of conflicts of interest between units at different levels of organization (such as gene and genome) may themselves be products of selection.",
