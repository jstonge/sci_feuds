In her experience, even if a particular insect species is acceptable to a particular predator, protracted feeding experiments often show that the predator cannot eat more than a few individuals, it refuses to take more, and it may even show evidence of ill-effects. Thus, the prey-species in question appears to be mildly poisonous (e.g. various ladybirds and some collembola). In such cases the population may be better protected by being massed together, even if the animals are easier to find than in cases of individual hibernation or roosting.",

As a rule, it is easy to see that individuals are dispersed in an appropriate way with respect to food-supply, and Lack himself was in some doubt as to how this was brought about. Obviously there is some involvement here of the habitat selection mechanism, i.e. the mechanism that leads populations into the habitat where, in the long run, they are able to compete. It may even be impossible to make a clear-cut division between these concepts, but the emphasis is somewhat different. This is not discussed in the book. W.-E. merely writes (p. 1) that dispersion may be defined to include habitat selection. There is no review of present knowledge of habitat selection, e.g. in birds. This is rather unimportant, however, in comparison with the failure in some sections of the book, to distinguish between dispersion and regulation of (total) numbers. This looseness of usage is already inherent in the title of the book (which is in fact concerned with the entire problem of numbers) and in the expression 'the dispersion hypothesis' or 'the theory of dispersion' (e.g. p. 21) pertaining to the author's (or Carr-Saunders') views. On p. 49 we read of \"dispersive responses, either by immediate movement of individuals, or by delayed action on recruitment rate\". A few lines previous to this (p. 48), it is said of an 'epideictic display' that it is \"concerned with dispersion and the regulation of numbers\", which seems to imply a distinction between these concepts. We thus have on the one hand dispersion sensu strictu, and on the other hand dispersion in a wide sense, practically synonymous with regulation of numbers. On many occasions one has to simply guess which is meant, and the reader may be carried imperceptibly from one concept to the other.",
