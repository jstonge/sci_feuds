C. WYNNE-EDWARDS published a paper on low reproductive rates in certain birds. This paper contained important arguments against views expounded with, what appeared to be strict and irrefutable logic, by LACK (e.g. 1954) , viz., that in birds and mammals the number of eggs laid, or young born, corresponds to the largest number of offspring possible to raise. Lack maintains that if, e.g., some individuals in a bird population (on account of hereditary difference), lay more eggs than others, and thus, on an average, leave a greater number of descendants, the result will be an increase of fertility to the point where the parents are unable to procure enough food for the offspring.\n##\nIt may be argued and this is the line taken by W.-E.both in the paper mentioned and in the book under reviewthat Lack's view rests on a mistaken notion of natural selection. The process of selection works, not only between individuals, but also between groups and between species, thus promoting characters which are to the benefit of the group, even in the face of contrary individual selection which may be kept in check by special devices. The existence of such evolutionary mechanisms is not only called for by a great many otherwise unaccountable facts, but is also in accordance with genetic evolutionary theory (see e.g. WRIGHT, 1945) .\n##\nSince the bulk of what follows will be in a critical vein, it would be as well to begin by stating that on this main point I am in perfect accordance with Wynne-Edwards. In fact, about 10 years ago, I wrote some books for Scandinavian readers (1952, 1953, and 1954) in which the importance of intergroup selection in connection with many points concerning social adaptation were stressed. 0. KALELA, who was concerned with the same problems, wrote, simultanously, notes which were still less accessible to most biologists owing to the fact they were written in Finnish. However, in 1954 he finally published a paper in German which, I think, is up to now one of the best introductions to the topic. It may be recommended in cases where critical readers of Wynne-Edwards' book, with little previous knowledge of vertebrate \"socio-ecology\", have been so scared by wild or even absurd theories that they are inclined to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n##\nAmong biologists who have laid the foundation for the notion of auto-regulating mechanisms, it is easy for Scandinavians to remember our good friend P. L. ERRING-TON, who has again and again, especially in connection with his life-long work on the muskratstressed the decisive influence of the mutual tolerance or aggression of the animals themselves, in regulating numbers. His work is only casually mentioned by W.-E. On the whole, considering the enormous size of the book and the many rather peripheral topics treated, it is surprising how incompletely the really pertinent points are reviewed. I think it may be said of the book, with a certain amount of truth, that most of what is sound in it is not new, and most of which is new is not sound. This in itself might not have been a very serious objection. If it had contained a good, well-digested, and balanced summary of facts and views on animals density regulation in relation to social behaviour, together with a clear statement of the problems (and on this foundation a statement of the more extreme theories of the author), it might have been a highly useful book.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n\"sentences\": [\n        {\n            \"text\": \"In 1955 V.

One point to which I shall revert later is the ambiguous use of the word dispersion in some chapters. (Usage in other chapters would appear to be in order. It is amusing to reflect that if this had been a religious text in the strict sense, philologists might, in some distant future, have referred these chapters to different authors). The term epideictic displays, \"signifying literally'meant for display' but connoting in its original Greek form the presenting of a sample\", is used consistently instead of such commonly used uncommittal terms as communal display, thus perhaps suggesting to the reader, not to mention the author, that the highly controversial theories involved have actually been proved.\n##\nThe author starts off with a rather convincing statement of the fundamental problem. He points out that there must be an optimum density of each species. Growth of a predator-population above a certain level can lead to over-exploitation of its resources, exemplified by the ravages caused by human \"overfishing\". It is characteristic that the exploitation of a stock of whales or fish may still be very profitable even at a time when the stock begins to suffer depletion. Before the pressure of the hunt decreases owing to diminished returns, the stock may already be lastingly damaged (northern right whales!). In any case the productivity will decline. The remedy is to determine the approximate optimum yield and limit the effort to match it (\"fish less and catch more\").\n##\n\"The importance of these inferences lies, of course, in the fact that there is no difference in principle between man exploiting fish or whales and any other predator exploiting any other prey. All predators face the same aspects of exactly the same problem. It is impossible to escape the conclusion, therefore, that something must, in fact, constantly restrain them, while in the midst of plenty, from over-exploiting their prey. Somehow or other 'free enterprise' or unchecked competition for food must be successfully averted, otherwise 'overfishing' would be impossible to escape: this could only result in lasting detriment to the predators and the risk, if they persisted in it, that the prey might be exterminated altogether.\" (p. 7-8). The author goes on to say that in general the same applies as forcibly to herbivores as to carnivores. Now, while this may of course, be broadly true, civilized man's exploitation by means of highly perfected mechanical devices has, on the other hand, certain peculiar traits. Further, I think too little notice is taken of the fact that at least some species are prevented from over-exploitation of resources by limiting factors other than 'intrinsic' ones, and, finally, it must be remembered that the problem is greatly complicated by the sharing of the same resources by several species. The author has provided an answer to the last point, but I do not think it is a correct one (see below).\n##\nIn any case, the probability, or even certainty, that auto-regulation of numbers is in the interest of species, is of value merely as an inducement to look for such devices. The author has brought together much good evidence, but his enthusiasm has, I think, very often carried him too far and it has given him a peculiarly one-sided outlook.\n##\nAs far as primitive man is concerned the notion of optimum numbers, auto-regulation of populations, and even the importance of intergroup selection, was already formulated by CARR-SAUNDERS in 1922 in a book which is fully cited by Wynne-Edwards. Carr-Saunders pointed out that territoriality is of great importance even among the most primitive races of mankind.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"paragraphs\": [\n    {\n

It may be said that while food or a mate or other requisites inside the habitat constitute the ultimate goal, the proximate goal is territory or social status.

Even if the 'alarm substance' is formed in the skin of the young some time before they themselves begin to show the reaction, there will still be time for them to be thinned out by the adults. (N.B. Here, again, is a social reaction the origin of which is only understandable by intergroup selection). Now, to revert to W.-E.'s ideas, it would certainly be carrying them very far in absurdum to maintain that social status is involved because the young are eaten by the mother and not the other way round, and, in any case, it is difficult to find any conventional competition in all this.\n##\nHowever, the author's favourite means for carrying such notions far back into the animal kingdom is the postulation of what he calls epideictic manifestations, instruments presumed to assess the population's own density and for becoming appropriately conditioned by it. The result of this conditioning is supposed to be control of the subsequent breeding output or dispersionary measures by emigration and the like.\n##\nGatherings of the most diverse kinds are believed to have this function: communal nuptial displays, \"leks\", aggregations for social roosting or hibernationeven the vertical migration of planktonic animals! The latter are thought to concentrate near the surface at fixed times of the day for 'epideictic' reasons.\n##\nIt is difficult, to say the least, to see how this conditioning could come about and in what way it could influence the reproductive output. The bogong moth, to take an example, (p. 314), forms immense aestivating aggregations in clefts and caves of granite outcrops on selected mountain tops in the Australian Alps of New South Wales. What difference would it make for the single moth (even with so much milling around) whether there be one or two million moths present in a particular year, and how could this influence its subsequent reproductive output?\n##\nAs a reason for believing that assemblages of this kind must have some special significance, the author maintains that, even if the finding of especially favoured sites for hibernation or roosting may thus be ensured, the gatherings may be harmful in making the population in question more vulnerable to predatory attack. Dr. ELLINOR BRO LARSEN has suggested to me an explanation involving exactly the opposite view. In her experience, even if a particular insect species is acceptable to a particular predator, protracted feeding experiments often show that the predator cannot eat more than a few individuals, it refuses to take more, and it may even show evidence of ill-effects. Thus, the prey-species in question appears to be mildly poisonous (e.g. various ladybirds and some collembola). In such cases the population may be better protected by being massed together, even if the animals are easier to find than in cases of individual hibernation or roosting.\n##\nIn many cases gatherings (usually with displays) of animals certainly have a special social significance, but I think that the hitherto favoured explanation, viz. that they help to effect the partitioning of the species into more or less discrete populations, is the correct one (to have group-selection we must have groups). This problem will be treated in a special publication (BRAESTRUP 1963) , to which a criticism of W.-E.'s peculiar views concerning the role of the males in regulating fecundity will also be deferred.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"1\": {\n        \"text\": \"The result of this conditioning is supposed to be control of the subsequent breeding output or dispersionary measures by emigration and the like.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"emigration\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"2\": {\n        \"text\": \"Gatherings of the most diverse kinds are believed to have this function: communal nuptial displays, \\\"leks\\\", aggregations for social roosting or hibernationeven the vertical migration of planktonic animals!\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"\\\"leks\\\"\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"text\": \"social roosting\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"text\": \"hibernation\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"3\": {\n        \"text\": \"It is difficult, to say the least, to see how this conditioning could come about and in what way it could influence the reproductive output.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 1,\n        \"mentions/references\": []\n    },\n    \"4\": {\n        \"text\": \"The bogong moth, to take an example, (p. 314), forms immense aestivating aggregations in clefts and caves of granite outcrops on selected mountain tops in the Australian Alps of New South Wales.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"bogong moth\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"5\": {\n        \"text\": \"As a reason for believing that assemblages of this kind must have some special significance, the author maintains that, even if the finding of especially favoured sites for hibernation or roosting may thus be ensured, the gatherings may be harmful in making the population in question more vulnerable to predatory attack.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 1,\n        \"mentions/references\": []\n    },\n    \"6\": {\n        \"text\": \"Dr. ELLINOR BRO LARSEN has suggested to me an explanation involving exactly the opposite view.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"Dr. ELLINOR BRO LARSEN\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"7\": {\n        \"text\": \"In many cases gatherings (usually with displays) of animals certainly have a special social significance, but I think that the hitherto favoured explanation, viz. that they help to effect the partitioning of the species into more or less discrete populations, is the correct one (to have group-selection we must have groups).\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": []\n    },\n    \"8\": {\n        \"text\": \"This problem will be treated in a special publication (BRAESTRUP 1963) , to which a criticism of W.-E.'s peculiar views concerning the role of the males in regulating fecundity will also be deferred.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"BRAESTRUP 1963\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"9\": {\n        \"text\": \"The exact age when the fright-reaction first occurs in the young is determined in some species: Phoxinus laevis 51 days, Leuciscus leuciscus 59 days, and in Rhodeus amarus 40 days after the young left the mussel, where they developed.\",\n        \"sentiment score\": 5,\n        \"mentions/references\": [\n            {\n                \"text\": \"Phoxinus laevis\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"text\": \"Leuciscus leuciscus\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"text\": \"Rhodeus amarus\",\n                \"sentiment score\": 5\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nInstructions:\n\n- Your task is to analyze articles that consist of many paragraphs.\n \n- Your analysis should contain the following:\n   \n- Does each sentence contains mentions or references to other authors (recall that names often start with upper case)?\n \n- Provide a sentiment score for the paragraphs from 1 to 9 (where 1 is most negative, 5 is neutral, and 9 is most positive).\n\n- Does each sentence contains mentions or references to theoretical constructs (theories that you could find on wikipedia such as natural selection, population genetics).  \n -

It is said that a complete partition of resources between different species is likely to involve narrower specialisation, with the final result that each species is confined to relatively few kinds of food-organisms, with a corresponding loss of resilience and stability should any of these fail (p. 395). Therefore, it may be an advantage \"to enter into various kinds of social and epideictic union, apparently for the purpose of syndicating their dispersion and mutually conserving common resources\" (p. 419). \"The adaptive value of mixed colonies comes primarily from the need, among species with overlapping foodresources, to take cognisance of the numbers of their competitors in regulating their own populations\" (p. 420). The cautious wording here, and various other signs of the author's uneasiness in these chapters, show that he is not quite unaware of the difficulties (to say the least) of this view. By what kind of evolutionary mechanism could such a mutual regulation come about? But it appears that the expression \"take cognisance of\" must mean that the breeding output is to some extent regulated according to the total number of individuals belonging to different species.\n##\nOf various closely related species which are difficult to tell apart by visual means (e.g. the species of Vespula) the author thinks that the resemblance may have been evolved, partly at least, for the sake of mutual integration. Among the examples mentioned we find, somewhat surprisingly, bees of the genus Halictus, of which there are many very similar species (some of them show beginnings of sociality, but this seems immaterial in the present connection). Sometimes very similar species nest together. It is apparently forgotten that in these bees an egg is never laid until food has been gathered for the larva in question, and furthermore the resources, honey and pollen, are not easily depleted, so here additional regulating mechanisms seem quite unnecessary.\n##\nThe author starts off these sections with an account of interspecific territoriality in birds, and in this way he endeavours to pave a less forbidding path to the rather hazardous theories which follow. Some semantic obscurities are also involved. I am certainly not, of course, accusing the author of intentionally confusing the issue. He is obviously honest in his endeavours to persuade the reader of the truth as he sees it. But it is a fact that the ambiguous use (in these and some other chapters) of the terms 'dispersion' and 'dispersive' tends to make it easier for the reader to swallow certain theories which with more exact presentation he would have left alone.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"paragraph1\": {\n    \"text\": \"The cautious wording here, and various other signs of the author's uneasiness in these chapters, show that he is not quite unaware of the difficulties (to say the least) of this view.\",\n    \"sentiment_score\": 3,\n    \"references\": {\n      \"complete partition of resources between different species\": 4,\n      \"social and epideictic union\": 5,\n      \"mixed colonies\": 5\n    }\n  },\n  \"paragraph2\": {\n    \"text\": \"Of various closely related species which are difficult to tell apart by visual means (e.g. the species of Vespula) the author thinks that the resemblance may have been evolved, partly at least, for the sake of mutual integration.\",\n    \"sentiment_score\": 5,\n    \"references\": {\n      \"resemblance may have been evolved\": 5\n    }\n  },\n  \"paragraph3\": {\n    \"text\": \"The author starts off these sections with an account of interspecific territoriality in birds, and in this way he endeavours to pave a less forbidding path to the rather hazardous theories which follow.\",\n    \"sentiment_score\": 3,\n    \"references\": {\n      \"interspecific territoriality in birds\": 3\n    }\n  }\n}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nInstructions:\n\n- Your task is to analyze articles that consist of many paragraphs.\n \n- Your analysis should contain the following:\n   \n- Does each sentence contains mentions or references to other authors (recall that names often start with upper case)?\n \n- Provide a sentiment score for the paragraphs from 1 to 9 (where 1 is most negative, 5 is neutral, and 9 is most positive).\n\n- Does each sentence contains mentions or references to theoretical constructs (theories that you could find on wikipedia such as natural selection, population genetics).  \n - Take into account opposing sentiments in the mentions or references to other authors (individuals that the author of the paragraph cite), but also be mindful of descriptive statements. \n NO NEED TO EXPLAIN OR COMMENT YOUR RESULTS. \n - Format your response in a json format where for each sentence,  provide the text, the overall sentiment score, any mentions or references with their associated sentiment scores.\n##\nHowever, after this necessary digression, we may revert to the question of competition between different species for the same food. In birds, where a great deal is known on this question, (LACK 1944, cf . also e.g. STRESEMANN 1948) , closely related species usually differ in exploiting different habitats or different parts of the same habitat.\n##\nWhen two forms which have just reached the species level during a period of geographical isolation, meet, one species may sometimes eliminate the other completely. Alternatively, they may continue to occupy different geographic regions, or they may be able to live side by side in either most of the combined range or in a broad or narrow zone of overlap. In the latter case, well marked ecological differences are always found between them (in accordance with Gause's principle), and it is characteristic that this divergence does not usually consist of specialisation in particular foods (which could lead to dangerous one-sideness, as W.-L. maintains). Competition is usually avoided by the habitat selection mechanism, by which each species is directed to the surroundings where it is superior.\n##\nIn a few cases it is known that interspecific territoriality is also involved. It is quite natural that this could happen in cases where the habitat is equally suitable for either species, but the habitat selection mechanism seems always to be the main agent in the case of sibling species.\n##\nMoreover, in cases where birds in the same habitat are more or less related, but evidently 'old' species there is not such a marked tendency to concentrate on any particular food species. They are more inclined to take food of different size (MADSEN 1954, on diving ducks), or they hunt in different parts of the same treesas in the case of three kinds of tits in conifer trees (HAFTORN 1956) .\n##\nLack also pointed out that closely related birds may have different winter quarters, and that, theoretically, if the limiting factors operate solely outside the breeding season, they may be able to mix freely when breeding. The garden warbler (Sylvia born) and the blackcap (S. atricapilla) (with different winter quarters), are rather similar ecologically, and it is interesting that they have been recorded to have interspecific territoriality. Unfortunately, however, knowledge on this point is still rather incomplete.\n##\nIn my opinion interspecific territoriality, interesting as it is, cannot be taken as an indication of the invalidity of Gause's theory. Similarly, it cannot be considered as proof of a mutual 'understanding' between species with similar ecologywith the aim of regulating the total numbers of both taken together in the interest of conserving common recources.\n##\nAll known facts are against the existence or possibility of a \"syndication\" of this kindand the danger of over-specialisation in any particular food is avoided in other ways.\n##\n-At one point, while wrestling with some of the most involved parts of Wynne-Edwards' work, I had occasion to re-read a portion of LACK'S book: 'The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers'. It was intellectually speaking, a feeling of emergence into the light after a long sojourn in a dark tunnel!
