872,laland_niche_2000,"Niche construction, biological evolution, and cultural change",2000-01-01,"We propose a conceptual model that maps the causal pathways relating biological evolution to cultural change. It builds on conventional evolutionary theory by placing emphasis on the capacity of
organisms to modify sources of natural selection in their environment (niche construction) and by broadening the evolutionary dynamic to incorporate ontogenetic and cultural processes. In this model,
phenotypes have a much more active role in evolution than generally conceived. This sheds light on hominid evolution, on the evolution of culture, and on altruism and cooperation. Culture amplifies
the capacity of human beings to modify sources of natural selection in their environments to the point where that capacity raises some new questions about the processes of human adaptation.","Laland, Kevin N. and Odling-Smee, John and Feldman, Marcus W."
176,smaldino_cultural_2014,The cultural evolution of emergent group-level traits,2014-01-01,"Many of the most important properties of human groups – including properties that may give one group an evolutionary advantage over another – are properly deﬁned only at the level of group
organization. Yet at present, most work on the evolution of culture has focused solely on the transmission of individual-level traits. I propose a conceptual extension of the theory of cultural
evolution, particularly related to the evolutionary competition between cultural groups. The key concept in this extension is the emergent group-level trait. This type of trait is characterized by the
structured organization of differentiated individuals and constitutes a unit of selection that is qualitatively different from selection on groups as deﬁned by traditional multilevel selection (MLS)
theory. As a corollary, I argue that the traditional focus on cooperation as the deﬁning feature of human societies has missed an essential feature of cooperative groups. Traditional models of
cooperation assume that interacting with one cooperator is equivalent to interacting with any other. However, human groups involve differential roles, meaning that receiving aid from one individual is
often preferred to receiving aid from another. In this target article, I discuss the emergence and evolution of group-level traits and the implications for the theory of cultural evolution, including
ramiﬁcations for the evolution of human cooperation, technology, and cultural institutions, and for the equivalency of multilevel selection and inclusive ﬁtness approaches.","Smaldino, Paul E."

particular interest in this context because it depends on the same kinds of mechanisms that lead to tree-like patterns of cultural variation. Here, we review ideas about cultural group selection
relevant to cultural phylogenetics. We discuss why group selection among multiple equilibria is not subject to the usual criticisms directed at group selection, why multiple equilibria are a common
phenomena, and why selection among multiple equilibria is not likely to be an important force in genetic evolution. We also discuss three forms of group competition and the processes that cause
populations to shift from one equilibrium to another and create a mutation-like process at the group level.","Boyd, Robert and Richerson, Peter J."

what it is saying and how it is supposed to be used. Here, I give a simple account of what Price's equation is, how it is derived, what it is saying and why this is useful. In particular, I suggest
that Price's equation is useful not primarily as a predictor of evolutionary change but because it provides a general theory of selection. As an illustration, I discuss some of the insights Price's

However, the relationship between these two theories
has been plagued by controversy for almost half a century and debates about their relevance and usefulness in explaining social evolution seem to rekindle at regular intervals. Here, we first provide
a concise introduction into the kin selection and multilevel selection theories and shed light onto the roots of the controversy surrounding them. We then review two major aspects of the current
debate: the presumed formal equivalency of the two theories and the question whether group selection can lead to group adaptation. We conclude by arguing that the two theories can offer complementary
approaches to the study of social evolution: kin selection approaches usually focus on the identification of optimal phenotypes and thus on the endresult of a selection process, whereas multilevel
selection approaches focus on the ongoing selection process itself. The two theories thus provide different perspectives that might be fruitfully combined to promote our understanding of the evolution
in group-structured populations.","Kramer, Jos and Meunier, Joël"

898,wilson_reintroducing_1994,Reintroducing group selection to the human behavioral sciences,1994-01-01,"Abstract In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is opposed
by a more individualistic one that treats social organization as a byproduct of self-interest. According to biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of natural selection at the
group level. Most biologists rejected group selection as an important evolutionary force during the 1960s and 1970s but a positive literature began to grow during the 1970s and is rapidly expanding
today. We review this recent literature and its implications for human evolutionary biology. We show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced emphasis on genes as “replicators”
which is in fact irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their functional organization. The fundamental question is whether social groups and other higher-level
entities can be “vehicles” of selection. When this elementary fact is recognized, group selection emerges as an important force in nature and what seem to be competing theories, such as kin selection
and reciprocity, reappear as special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of natural selection that operates on a nested hierarchy of units. The vehicle-based theory makes it clear
that group selection is an important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals to “organs” of group-level “organisms.” Human
behavior not only reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also alter the balance through the construction of social structures that have the effect of reducing fitness differences
within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at the group level. These social structures and the cognitive abilities that produce them allow group selection to be
important even among large groups of unrelated individuals.","Wilson, David Sloan and Sober, Elliott"

relate my own expectations and predictions based on soft selection with facts described by Wynne-Edwards, and a third criticizing the argument that has been advanced for group selection. A number of
important studies have been summarized in this book. Foremost is the extensive work on red grouse with which Wynne-Edwards has been associated for more than 30years. A great deal of ecological,
physiological, nutritional, and behavioural information regarding this bird has been reviewed in seven chapters (pp. 84-170) with additional comments liberally sprinkled elsewhere. Anyone interested
in avian biology who has missed this important study must read this book. Also extensively reviewed is the work of Michael Wade on group selection in Tribolium, the flour beetle. Wade's data are
presented in enough detail that his work can be understood by those who have not seen the original publications. [Twice (pp. 210 and 233) reference is made to a 40-fold difference between two of
Wade's selected lines, whereas the figure on p. 209 suggests that the difference is nearer 7-fold. Figure 11-16 also contains an error.] A number of other studies have been reviewed in some, but not
exhaustive, detail. Among these are Smithers and Terry's analysis of immunology in schistosomiasis, Birdsell's studies of the social structure of Australian aborigines and Sewell Wright's shifting

en gendered much controversy. Many have accepted Lack's view (1954) that the number of individuals in a population is directly limited by (and balanced with) the food supply of an environment, some
animals simply starving when the numbers have exceeded the food resources. Others have taken exception to this view, and have proposed rather that the essential control consists in preventing food
shortages by limiting pop ulation size at a level commensurate with the resources of the environ ment. This view has been championed especially by the Finnish workers Kalela (1957) and Koskimies
(1955) and has been most extensively elaborated by Wynne-Edwards in his stimulating book Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior (1962), in which he has developed a hy pothesis which
incorporates a diverse array of social behaviors within the single functional categorization of population regulation. Briefly stated, his hypothesis proposes that, while food is generally the
environmental resource which ultimately limits animal populations, free contest among individuals for food must in the long run end in over-exploitation of the resource and damage the habitat or lead
to mass starvation. This situa tion is usually avoided by the substitution of ""conventional rewards,"" such as territories, living space, social rank, etc., in place of the actual food itself.
Competition for these conventional rewards operates homeo statically, adjusting the population density at the ""optimum"" level in relation to fluctuating levels of food resources and thereby preventing
increases to densities that would cause over-exploitation and the deple tion of future yields. Many social displays are ""epidiectic,"" serving to indicate the density of individuals present in a
locality, and thus provide the feedback to adjust or restore the appropriate balance between popula tion density and consumable resources. Much of conventional competiton involves subordination of the
welfare of individuals to that of the social group to which they belong. Such mechanisms could only have arisen through a process of ""group selection,"" in which populations with the appropriate
behavioral mechanisms would regulate their density and 1 V. C. Wynne-Edwards is Regius Professor of Natural History at Marischal Col lege of the University of Aberdeen. A graduate of Oxford, he has

342,smith_group_1976,Group {Selection},1976-01-01,"T H HE PURPOSE of this short review is to look at some recent discussions of group selection, in particular those by E. 0. Wilson (1975), D. S. Wilson (1975) and M. E. Gilpin (1975). Earlier work will
be referred to only briefly; the need for a review arises because the three references given either propose a blurring of the distinction between ""group"" and ""kin"" selection, or suggest an importance
for group selection greater than it has usually been given, or both. The first point to establish is that the argument is quantitative, not qualitative. Group selection will have evolutionary
consequences; the only question is how important these consequences have been. If there are genes which, although decreasing individual fitness, make it less likely that a group (deme or species) will
go extinct, then group extinction will influence evolution. It does not follow that the influence is important enough to play the role suggested for it by some biologists. The present phase of the
debate about group selection was opened by the publication of Wynne-Edwards' ""Animal Dispersion"" (1962), which applied to animals a concept first proposed by Carr-Saunders (1922) to explain human
population dynamics; it ascribed to group selection a major role in the evolution of population regulation. Although his thesis has had its adherents, the orthodox response from ecologists has been to
argue that the patterns of behavior he described can be explained by individual selection, and from population geneticists that the mechanism he proposes is insufficient to account for the results. It
is in the nature of science that once a position becomes orthodox it should be subjected to criticism; hence the papers by D. S. Wilson (1975), Gilpin (1975), Levin and Kilmer (1974), Gadgil (1975),
and others. It does not follow that, because a position is orthodox, it is wrong; hence this review. Is the argument important? In a recent review of E. 0. Wilson's ""Sociobiology,"" C. H. Waddington
referred to group selection as ""a fashionable topic for a rather foolish controversy."" Doubtless some foolish things have been said, but there is an important issue at stake. If group selection has
played the role suggested by Wynne-Edwards, no one can doubt its importance. But why should it be important to argue that it has not? The reason for the vehemence with which Williams (1966, 1975),
Ghiselin (1974), Lack (1966) and other opponents of group selection have argued their case is, I think, their conviction that group selection assumptions, often tacit or unconscious, have been
responsible for the failure to tackle important problems. So long as we fail to distinguish group and individual selection, or assume that an explanation in terms of advantage to the species is
adequate to account for the evolution of some behavior pattern or genetic process, without asking what is its effect on individual fitness, we shall make little progress. The extent of unconscious

28,alcock_textbook_2003,A textbook history of animal behaviour,2003-01-01,"Abstract The history of animal behaviour research over the last 50 years has been marked by a decline in traditional ethology and an increase in the prominence of behavioural ecology. Here I examine
these changes in the discipline of animal behaviour during the past 50 years as reflected in specialized behaviour textbooks and introductory textbooks for general biology courses. Prior to 1975, all
the behaviour texts devoted far more coverage to ethological research on the proximate causes of behaviour than to research on the adaptive value of behavioural traits. After 1975, ultimate questions
about adaptation received much more attention than they had previously. The change took place because of events in the mid-1960s, including W. D. Hamilton's solution to the evolutionary puzzle of
altruism and the group selection debate involving V. C. Wynne-Edwards, G. C. Williams and D. Lack. The effect of these events was to encourage researchers to use sound adaptationist theory untainted
by species-benefit thinking. The theory helped identify many new questions about the adaptive value of behavioural traits, stimulating workers to give as much weight to these issues as had previously
been devoted to research into the physiology and development of behaviour. Although pure ethological research appeared to decline after 1975, in fact the major proximate concerns of ethology were
simply taken on by cell biologists and neurophysiologists who used tools not available to the classic ethologist. The result was the development of neuroethology, which has flourished over the years.
However, classic (pre-1975) ethological research still receives considerable coverage in many introductory biology textbooks, possibly because of the weight given these studies by W. T. Keeton in his
influential textbook. None the less, ever since the 1980s, most biology textbooks have also discussed some of the fruits of adaptationist theory, especially Hamilton's explanation for altruism,
thereby providing a more balanced treatment of proximate and ultimate issues than was once the case. Copyright 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science

animals of the same species usually are of a ‘limited war’ type, not causing serious injury. They emphasized that game theory is an alternative to previous ideas about group selection, which were used
by ethologists to explain limited aggression. Subsequently, the ESS concept was applied to many phenomena with frequency dependence in the evolutionary success of strategies, including sex allocation,
alternative mating types, contest behaviour and signalling, cooperation, and parental care. Both the analyses of signalling and cooperation were inspired by similar problems in economics and attracted
much attention in biology. Here we give a perspective on which of the ambitions in the field have been achieved, with a focus on contest behaviour and cooperation. We evaluate whether the game-
theoretical study of the evolution of cooperation has measured up to expectations in explaining the behaviour of non-human animals. We also point to potentially fruitful directions for the field, and

each catalysed the other. The first models were applied to animal contests, and early workers sought to improve their biological reality to compare predictions with observations. Furthermore, it was
quickly realized that EGT provided a general evolutionary modelling method; not only was it swiftly applied to diverse phenotypic adaptations in evolutionary biology, it also attracted researchers
from other disciplines such as mathematics and economics, for which game theory was first devised. Lastly, we pay attention to exchanges with population geneticists, considering tensions between the
two modelling methods, as well as efforts to bring them closer. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Half a century of evolutionary games: a synthesis of theory, application and future

accepted concepts regarding the nature of the evolution process. However, a number of modern evolutionary mechanics concepts such as group selection and evolvability suggest that an individually
adverse trait like aging can evolve if it creates an advantage (reduced probability of extinction) for a population. Genetics discoveries suggest that aging creates multiple population advantages and,
therefore, aging programs that purposely cause and regulate aging evolved in mammals. This led to various concepts regarding the nature of the program. One such concept is that aging is a completely
genetically specified function of age, essentially a biological clock. However, this article presents evidence and theoretical basis for the idea that the programmed aging function is controlled by an
adaptive mechanism that can sense local or temporary conditions that affect the optimum aging function and adjust it to compensate for those conditions. This issue is important for medical research
because the sensing mechanisms and associated signaling provide additional points at which intervention in the aging process and associated highly age-related diseases could be attempted.","Goldsmith, Theodore C."

Using a quantitative individual-based method based on the stochastic process, we
identify that enhancing the inherent self-proliferation advantage of cooperators relative to defectors is a more effective channel to promote the evolution of cooperation in range expansion than
weakening the benefit acquisition of defectors from cooperators. With this self-proliferation advantage, cooperators can rapidly colonize virgin space and establish spatial segregation more readily,
which acts like a protective shield to further promote the evolution of cooperation in return. We also show that lower cell density and migration rate have a positive effect on the competition of
cooperators with defectors. Biological evolution is based on competition between individuals and should therefore favor selfish behaviors. However, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon that the
evolution of a population is impeded by the fitness-enhancing chemotactic movement of individuals. This highlights a conflict between the interests of the individual and the population. The short-
sighted selfish behavior of individuals may not be that favored in the competition between populations. Such information provides important implications for the handling of cooperation.","Wang, Xiaoliang and Harrison, Andrew"

Applying AIC model-selection, I find
that selection-regulated population dynamics is 25, 000 (95\%:0.42–1.7 e 17) times more probable than density-regulated growth. Selection is essential in 94\% of the best models explaining 82\% of the
population dynamics variance across the North American continent. Similar results are obtained for 111, 215, and 420 populations of British birds (BTO 2020), Danish birds (DOF 2020), and birds and

population densities, and sub-optimal reproduction from famine at carrying capacities with strong competition for limited resources—is not supported. Selection regulation generates a new paradigm
where the world is green and individuals are selected to survive and reproduce at optimal levels at population dynamic equilibria with sufficient resources. It is only the acceleration of the
population dynamic growth rate, and not the growth rate itself, that is determined by the density-dependent environment, with maximal growth occurring at the densities of the population dynamic
equilibrium.","Witting, Lars"

Detailed observation and analysis of modified hairs

communication in two species of porcupine (Hystrix indica and Hystrix brachyura). The lipid profiles of these modified epidermal structures were analysed with the aid of High Performance Thin Layer
Chromatography and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Lipid profile of all the individuals of the two species of porcupine was dominated by the presence of free fatty acids and cholesterol. The
fatty acid composition of total lipid shows the presence of both low and high carbon saturated fatty acids along with monounsaturates and polyunsaturates. The presence of an appreciable amount of
polyunsaturates in these tissues is significant for generation of signaling molecules. The identified fatty acids of the quills were also quantitated and the quantitative variation of the different
fatty acids may act as a ‘signature of identity’, a prerequisite for pheromonal molecules. It is hypothesized that low carbon fatty acids of these epidermal lipids are directly taking part in chemical
communication and high carbon fatty acids are acting as fixatives for lengthening the duration of volatility.","Raha, Paramaa"

the enactivist conception of bringing forth a world literally in three conceptual levels: enaction, niche construction and social construction. Based on this proposal, we claim that enactivism is
compatible with the idea of an independent reality without committing to the claim that organisms have cognitive access to a world composed of properties specified prior to any cognitive activity. Our
second goal is to show that our literal interpretation of bringing forth a world not only sustains the legitimacy of the middle way, but it also allows us to revive the conception of evolution as
natural drift—which is perhaps the least examined aspect of the original enactivist theory and is central to the understanding of cognition in an enactive way. Natural drift focuses on how structural
couplings between organism and environment trigger viable pathways of maintenance and reproduction, instead of selecting the most adapted trait to a pregiven environment. Thus, although enactivists
typically do not explore the consequences of their views regarding evolutionary dynamics, we show how natural drift provides a suitable starting point.","Rolla, Giovanni and Figueiredo, Nara"

conditions. We hypothesized that crowding stress and aggression-associated oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in specific regions of the brain may be closely related to aggressive behaviors
and population changes of small rodents. We analyzed the association of OT and AVP expression, aggressive behavior, and population density of Brandt’s voles in 24 large semi-natural enclosures
(0.48 ha each) in Inner Mongolia grassland. We tested the effects of population density on the OT/AVP system and aggressive behavior by experimentally manipulating populations of Brandt’s voles in the
grassland enclosures. High density was positively and significantly associated with more aggressive behavior, and increased expression of mRNA and protein of AVP and its receptor, but decreased
expression of mRNA and protein of OT and its receptor in specific brain regions of the voles. Our study suggests that changes in OT/AVP expression are likely a result of the increased psychosocial
stress that these voles experience during overcrowding, and thus the OT/AVP system can be used as indicators of density-dependent stressors in Brandt’s voles.","Huang, Shuli and Li, Guoliang and Pan, Yongliang and Liu, Jing and Zhao, Jidong and Zhang, Xin and Lu, Wei and Wan, Xinrong and Krebs, Charles J. and Wang, Zuoxin and Han, Wenxuan and Zhang, Zhibin"

latitude, both within and across species, but the mechanism(s) driving that pattern continue to generate hypotheses and debate. In 1961, a Ph.D. student at Oxford University, N. Philip Ashmole,
proposed the influential hypothesis that clutch size varies in direct proportion to the seasonality of resources available to a population. Ashmole's hypothesis has been widely cited and discussed in
the ecological literature. However, misinterpretation and confusion has been common regarding the mechanism that underlies Ashmole's hypothesis and the testable predictions it generates. We review the
development of well‐known hypotheses to explain clutch size variation with an emphasis on Ashmole's hypothesis. We then discuss and clarify sources of confusion about Ashmole's hypothesis in the
literature, summarise existing evidence in support and refutation of the hypothesis, and suggest some under‐utilised and novel approaches to test Ashmole's hypothesis and gain an improved
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for variation in avian clutch size and fecundity, and life‐history evolution in general.","Lundblad, Carl G. and Conway, Courtney J."
4,barbier_macroecological_2021,A macro‐ecological approach to predation density‐dependence,2021-01-01,"Predation often deviates from the law of mass action: many microand meso-scale experiments have shown that consumption saturates with resource abundance, and decreases due to interference between
consumers. But does this observation hold at macro-ecological scales, spanning many species and orders of magnitude in biomass? If so, what are its consequences for large-scale ecological patterns and
dynamics? We perform a meta-analysis of predator–prey pairs of mammals, birds and reptiles, and show that total predation rates appear to increase, not as the product of predator and prey densities
following the Lotka–Volterra (mass action) model, but rather as the square root of that product. This suggests a phenomenological power-law expression of the effective cross-ecosystem predation rate.
We discuss whether the same powerlaw may hold dynamically within an ecosystem, and assuming that it does, we explore its consequences in a simple food chain model. The empirical exponents fall close
to the boundary between regimes of donor and consumer limitation. Exponents on this boundary are singular in multiple ways. First, they maximize predator abundance and some stability metrics. Second,
they create proportionality relations between biomass and productivity, both within and between trophic levels. These intuitive relations do not hold in general in mass action models, yet they are
widely observed empirically. These results provide evidence of mechanisms limiting predation across multiple ecological scales. Some of this evidence was previously associated with donor control, but
we show that it supports a wider range of possibilities, including forms of consumer control. As limiting consumption counter-intuitively allows larger populations, it is worthwhile to reconsider
whether the observed predation rates arise from microscopic mechanisms, or could hint at selective pressure at the population level.","Barbier, Matthieu and Wojcik, Laurie and Loreau, Michel"

The hydrofoils have an out-of-phase synchronization and they
are varied through in-line, staggered, and side-by-side arrangements within the two-dimensional interaction plane. It is discovered that there is a two-dimensionally stable equilibrium point for a
sideby-side arrangement. In fact, this arrangement is super-stable, meaning that hydrodynamic forces will passively maintain this arrangement even under external perturbations and the school as a
whole has no net forces acting on it, causing it to drift to one side or the other. Moreover, previously discovered one-dimensionally stable equilibria driven by wake vortex interactions are shown to
be, in fact, two-dimensionally unstable, at least for an out-of-phase synchronization. Additionally, it is discovered that a trailing-edge vortex mechanism provides the restorative force to stabilize
a side-by-side arrangement and the stable equilibrium is further verified for freelyswimming foils where dynamic recoil motions are present. When constrained, the swimmers experience a collective
thrust and efficiency increase up to 100\% and 40\%, respectively, in a side-by-side arrangement, whereas the staggered arrangements output an even higher efficiency improvement of 87\% with a 94\%
increase in thrust. For freely-swimming foils, the recoil motion attenuates the improvements at the stable equilibrium, showing a more modest speed and efficiency enhancement of up to 9\% and 6\%,
respectively. These newfound schooling performance and stability characteristics suggest that fluid-mediated equilibria may play a role in the control strategies of schooling fish and fish-inspired
robots.","Kurt, Melike and Ormonde, Pedro C. and Mivehchi, A. and Moored, K."

components that modify female reproduction, and optimal ejaculation strategies), an aspect not considered by Darwin in his classic treatise of 1871. Sperm competition has subsequently been studied in
many taxa, and post-copulatory sexual selection is now considered an important sequel to Darwinian pre-copulatory sexual selection. The second, “The origin and evolution of gamete dimorphism and the
male-female phenomenon” (Journal of Theoretical Biology, 1972) showed how selection, based on gamete competition between individuals, can give rise to anisogamy in an isogamous broadcast spawning
ancestor. This theory, which has subsequently been developed in various ways, is argued to form the most powerful explanation of why there are two sexes in most multicellular organisms. Together, the
two papers have influenced our general understanding of the evolutionary differentiation of the two forms of gametic cells, and the divergence of sexual strategies between males and females under

This paper
investigates how to promote the evolution of cooperation in the Prisoner’s Dilemma game (PDG). Differing from previous approaches, we not only propose a tag-based control (TBC) mechanism but also look
at how the evolution of cooperation by TBC can be successfully promoted. The effect of TBC on the evolutionary process of cooperation shows that it can both reduce the payoff of defectors and inhibit
defection; although when the cooperation rate is high, TBC will also reduce the payoff of cooperators unless the identified rate of the TBC is large enough. An optimal timing control (OTC) of switched
replicator dynamics is designed to consider the control costs, the cooperation rate at terminal time, and the cooperator’s payoff. The results show that the switching control (SC) between an optimal
identified rate control of the TBC and no TBC can properly not only maintain a high cooperation rate but also greatly enhance the payoff of the cooperators. Our results provide valuable insights for
some clusters, for example, logistics parks and government, to regard the decision to promote cooperation.","Dong, Rui and Jia, Xinghong and Wang, Xianjia and Chen, Yonggang"

involves criticizing the common claim that Elton’s idea of species as fulfilling functional roles within ecological communities committed him to an idea of communities as units of selection. While
such a claim implicitly attributes to Elton an understanding of function along the lines of the selected-effects theory of function advocated by many biologists and philosophers of biology, Elton’s
use of the niche concept, I maintain, involves an understanding of function more along the lines of alternative nonselectionist theories such as the causal-role, goal-contribution, and organizational
theories. I also briefly discuss how ecologists after Elton also tend to have typically adopted a nonselectionist understanding of the function concept, similar to his.","Dussault, Antoine C."

It is also about social interaction - the building-blocks of this group
identity. In particular, I investigate music’s role in our social landscape. Making music together is a powerful way of establishing and structuring these relationships; I argue that it can bring
people together, but can also reinforce the divisions between them. First, I present a new synthesis, drawing on relevant literature about our capacity for sociality, analyses of social interaction,
and a history of the research on social groups. I outline a helpful framework by which to understand different forms of social engagement, depending on the nature of the interaction goal; I also
clarify the concepts of interdependence and categorisation as distinct processes in group formation. Following this, I suggest that when our interaction is primarily affiliative, or relational, in
goal (with little or no external goal focus), then it brings people together via relationships of interdependence; when we aim to communicate something more precisely (i.e. we have an external goal),
then the need to maintain our common ground might instead form the basis for social division via categorisation. Second, I report an initial empirical project which tests some of these predictions. My
experiments show that music-making enhances affiliation, especially when there is no external goal focus. Adding a goal contributes to social division - affiliation on the basis of common team
membership - but only when the interaction task was a success. When it was not successful, or caused embarrassment for those involved, participants instead seem to distance themselves from any
associated group identity. This experimental work is supported by video analyses, in which I show different patterns of behaviour in interaction with and without an external goal. This thesis is an
important starting point in understanding the nature both of social groups and of music. It highlights the potential for music-making to structure our social world through either affiliation or
division.","Whiteman, Rebecca"

their young. In social species, cooperation is limited to relatives and (maybe) small groups of reciprocators. After a brief period of maternal support, individuals acquire virtually all of the food
that they eat. There is little division of labor, no trade, and no large scale conflict. Communication is limited to a small repertoire of self-verifying signals. No one cares for the sick, or feeds
the hungry or disabled. The strong take from the weak without fear of sanctions by third parties. Amend Hobbes to account for nepotism, and his picture of the state of nature is not so far off for
most other animals. In contrast, people in even the simplest human societies regularly cooperate with many unrelated individuals. Human language allows low-cost honest communication of virtually
unlimited complexity. The sick are cared for, and sharing leads to substantial flows of food from the middle aged to the young and old. Division of labor and trade are prominent features of every
historically known human society, and archaeology indicates that they have a long history. Violent conflict among sizable groups is common. In every human society, social life is regulated by commonly

pathogens within a single host individual. Rapid replication of individual viruses is selected for, but if this replication debilitates the host before transmission occurs, the entire group of viruses
in that host may perish. Thus, rapid transmission can favor more pathogenic strains, while slower transmission can favor less pathogenic strains. Available data suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 may follow this
pattern. Indeed, high population density and other circumstances that favor rapid transmission may also favor more deadly strains. Health care workers, exposed to pathogenic strains of hospitalized
patients, may be at greater risk. The low case fatality rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may reflect the founder effect—an initial infection with a mild strain. A vaccine made with one strain
may confer limited immunity to other strains. Variation among strains may lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to therapeutics. Finally, if less pathogenic strains are largely associated with
mild disease, rather than treating all SARS‐CoV‐2 positive individuals equally, priority could be focused on testing and contact tracing the most seriously symptomatic patients.","Blackstone, Neil W and Blackstone, Sarah R and Berg, Anne T"

of the memetics theory that could bias memeticists to work on the ontology of meme units as opposed to hypotheses testing, which was adopted by the gene-culture scholars. I trace this problem back to
the diachronic development of memetics to its origin in the gene-centered anti-group-selectionist argument of George C. Williams and Richard Dawkins. The strict adoption of this argument predisposed
memeticists with the a priori idea that there is no evolution without discrete units of selection, which in turn, made them dependent on the principal separation of biological and memetic fitness.
This separation thus prevented memeticists from accepting an adaptationist view of culture which, on the contrary, allowed gene-culture theorists to attract more scientists to test the hypotheses,
creating the historical success of the gene-culture coevolution theory.","Chvaja, Radim"

the effects of density‐induced social stress are still unknown. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are small herbivores in the grassland of China, but the underlying neurological mechanism of
population regulation is still unknown. We tested the effects of housing density of Brandt's voles on OT/AVP system with physical contact (allowing aggression) and without physical contact (not
allowing aggression) under laboratory conditions. Then, we tested the effects of paired‐aggression (no density effect) of Brandt's voles on OT/AVP system under laboratory conditions. We hypothesized
that high density would increase aggression among animals which would then increase AVP but reduce OT in brains of animals. Our results showed that high housing density induced more aggressive
behavior. We found high‐density‐induced social stress (with or without physical contact) and direct aggression significantly increased expression of mRNA and protein of AVP and its receptor, but
decreased expression of mRNA and protein of OT and its receptor in specific brain regions of voles. The results suggest that density‐dependent change of OT/AVP systems may play a significant role in

Commonly, these swimmers shed a classic reverse von Kármán wake,
however, schooling eels produce a bifurcated wake topology with two vortex rings shed per oscillation cycle. To examine the schooling interactions of a hydrofoil with a bifurcated wake topology, we
present tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomo PIV) measurements of the flow interactions and direct force measurements of the performance of two low-aspect-ratio hydrofoils ( A R = 0.5 ) in an
in-line and a staggered arrangement. Surprisingly, when the leader and follower are interacting in either arrangement there are only minor alterations to the flowfields beyond the superposition of the
flowfields produced by the isolated leader and follower. Motivated by this finding, Garrick’s linear theory, a linear unsteady hydrofoil theory based on a potential flow assumption, was adapted to
predict the lift and thrust performance of the follower. Here, the follower hydrofoil interacting with the leader’s wake is considered as the superposition of an isolated pitching foil with a time-
varying cross-stream velocity derived from the wake flow measurements of the isolated leader. Linear theory predictions accurately capture the time-averaged lift force and some of the major peaks in
thrust derived from the follower interacting with the leader’s wake in a staggered arrangement. The thrust peaks that are not predicted by linear theory are likely driven by spatial variations in the
flowfield acting on the follower or nonlinear flow interactions; neither of which are accounted for in the simple theory. This suggests that unsteady potential flow theory that does account for
spatial variations in the flowfield acting on a hydrofoil can provide a relatively simple framework to understand and model the flow interactions that occur in schooling fish. Additionally, schooling
eels can derive thrust and efficiency increases of 63-80\% in either a in-line or a staggered arrangement where the follower is between two branched momentum jets or with one momentum jet branch

young girls. What is special about the Price equation is the way in which it associates statistically between two groups, a ‘mother’ and ‘daughter’ population. The association need not mean genetic
relatedness in the narrow sense of direct descent, and it allows us to see selection working at different levels simultaneously, a fact that was not lost on William Hamilton. Hamilton was one of the

Here, I use a causal framework and the Price equation to develop the gene's eye
perspective. Genes are causally special in being both replicators and interactors. Gene effects are tied together in a complex Gouldian knot of interactions, but Fisher deployed three swords to try to
cut the knot. The first, Fisher's average excess, is non-causal, so not fully satisfactory in that respect. The Price equation highlights Fisher's other two swords, choosing to model only selection,
and only the part that is transmissible across generations. The models developed here show that many causes of organismal fitness do not cause Gouldian complications. Only two kinds of elements must
be added to the focal gene for a causal explanation of its selective change: co-replicators that are associated with the focal gene and co-interactors that interact non-additively with the focal gene.
Identical equations for co-replication and co-interaction describe interactions between gene copies at a single locus or at separate loci, and also for genes situated within the same individual or in

their notoriety as enemies of plant growers, aphids are also extremely interesting scientifically, especially at the molecular and genetic levels. They reproduce mainly asexually, one female producing

the agro-ecosystem, regardless of our best efforts to combat them.","Loxdale, Hugh D and Balog, Adalbert and Biron, David G"

population’s ability to survive and grow? Or is aging non-programmed because aging reduces an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce? There has been little disagreement with the many proposed
population benefits of senescence, but evolution theory as described by Darwin and currently taught is very individual-oriented and until recently, programmed aging has been widely thought to be
theoretically impossible. However, genetics discoveries have exposed issues with traditional theory that support population-driven evolution and programmed aging. In particular, as described in this
article, the discovery that biological inheritance involves the transmission of information in digital form between parent and descendant of any organism strongly supports population-oriented
evolution concepts and dependent programmed aging theories. A related issue concerns evolvability. Traditional theory assumes that the ability to evolve (evolvability) and involving mutations and
natural selection is an inherent property of life. Evolvability theories suggest that evolvability in complex species is instead mainly itself the result of evolved traits and that such traits can
evolve even if individually adverse. Programmed aging theories based on evolvability suggest that aging has evolved because it increases evolvability causing a population benefit. This idea is also
strongly supported by the digital nature of inheritance. The programmed vs. non-programmed issue is critical to medical research because the two concepts suggest that very different biological
mechanisms are responsible for aging and most instances of age-related disease.","Goldsmith, T. C."

cooperation, and conflict. For example, some researchers suggest that cooperation and prosociality evolved by natural selection (Hamilton 1964, Trivers 1971, Axelrod and Hamilton 1981, De Waal 2013,
2014), while others claim that natural selection is insufficient for the evolution of cooperation, which required in addition cultural selection (Sterelny 2013, Bowles and Gintis 2003, Seabright 2013,
Norenzayan 2013). Some scholars focus on the complexity and hierarchical nature of the evolution of cooperation as involving different tools associated with lower and the higher levels of competition
(Nowak 2006, Okasha 2006); others suggest that humans genetically inherited heuristics that favor prosocial behavior such as generosity, forgiveness or altruistic punishment (Ridley 1996, Bowles and
Gintis 2004, Rolls 2005). We argue these mechanisms are not genetically inherited; rather, they are features inherited through cultural selection. To support this view we invoke inclusive fitness
theory, which states that individuals tend to maximize their inclusive fitness, rather than maximizing group fitness. We further reject the older notion of natural group selection - as well as more
recent versions (West, Mouden, Gardner 2011) – which hold that natural selection favors cooperators within a group (Wynne-Edwards 1962). For Wynne-Edwards, group selection leads to group adaptations;
the survival of individuals therefore depends on the survival of the group and a sharing of resources. Individuals who do not cooperate, who are selfish, face extinction due to rapid and over-
exploitation of resources.","Szocik, Konrad and Herian, Robert"

logarithmic effects of time. We found a significantly asymmetrical impact of between-group competition, where the between-group competition factor appeared to be driving the diachronic integration in
Gallic populations but had no significantly corresponding influence on the parallel process of diachronic differentiation in Britannic populations. This suggests that the latter process was
attributable to some alternative and unmeasured causes, such as the resource abundance consequent to territorial expansion rather than contraction.","Figueredo, Aurelio José and Peñaherrera-Aguirre, Mateo and Fernandes, Heitor Barcellos Ferreira and Lomayesva, Sara Lindsey and Woodley, Michael Anthony and Hertler, Steven Charles and Sarraf, Matthew Alexandar"

Sociology emerged as a discipline when the notion of
evolution was actively used in biology, geology, and emerging social sciences. Throughout the nineteenth century, many of the most prominent early European sociologists examined the social universe
from an evolutionary perspective; and this perspective was borrowed in much of early American sociology in the last decades of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth century.
By the end of the second decade of the twentieth Century, however, evolutionary analysis was rapidly disappearing in sociology in the United States, and by the 1930s, it was pretty much dead. And for
the remainder of the twentieth century, it was viewed with a great suspicion, especially evolutionary approaches that sought to incorporate ideas from biology into the field. Despite the revival of
stage models of societal evolution and the emergence of new ecological approaches in the 1960s and 1970s, evolutionary ideas from biology were still rejected by most American sociologists though much
of the twentieth century. In this paper, we first present the history of this rejection of evolutionary, with the goal of encouraging sociologists today to recognize the distortions and
misrepresentations of Darwinian and Spencerian ideas that fueled intellectual prejudices for so many decades. These prejudices only get in the way of sociology in the twenty-first century, where
biological ideas have begun to pervade the social sciences. Thus, American sociologists should now take stock and reconsider how much evolutionary and biological analysis can help sociology and,
equally if not more important, how an informed evolutionary sociology can influence those in the other social sciences and even those in the biological sciences.","Schutt, Russell K. and Turner, Jonathan H."

Yet the two disciplines of evolution and ecology were not unified in the twentieth-century. The architects of the Modern Synthesis, and especially Julian Huxley, constantly pushed for such
integration, but the major ideas of the Synthesis—namely, the privileged role of selection and the key role of gene frequencies in evolution—did not directly or immediately translate into ecological
science. In this paper I consider five stages through which the Synthesis was integrated into ecology and distinguish between various ways in which a possible integration was gained. I start with
Elton’s animal ecology (1927), then consider successively Ford’s ecological genetics in the 1940s, the major textbook Principles of animal ecology edited by Allee et al. (1949), and the debates over
the role of competition in population regulation in the 1950s, ending with Hutchinson’s niche concept (1959) and McArthur and Wilson’s Principles of Island Biogeography (1967) viewed as a formal
transposition of Modern Synthesis explanatory schemes. I will emphasize the key role of founders of the Synthesis at each stage of this very nonlinear history.","Huneman, Philippe"

limited research on salp physiology and no studies that examine how changes in environmental factors such as temperature and dissolved oxygen impact basic physiological processes. Here I examine
temperature and oxygen partial pressure effect on metabolism in blastozooids of Salpa fusiformis. Routine metabolic rates of 1.66 and 3.95 μmol O2 g−1 h−1 wet weight at 10°C and 17°C, respectively,

hypoxic waters in the California Current, and potential impacts on carbon output. Metabolic rates for S. fusiformis are compared to metabolic rates published for other species of salps and gelatinous

reveal that selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of “opposite responses to selection.” Using quantitative genetic
models for the response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes direct selection, when individuals
interact with others less related to them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss the likelihood of each of
these occurring in nature and therefore summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be. This links several evolutionary phenomena within a single framework.","Fisher, David N. and Pruitt, Jonathan N."

Since Buss (The evolution of individuality, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1987) and the work of Maynard Smith and Szathmary (The major transitions in evolution, Oxford University Press,
Oxford, 1995) biologists were eager to explain the major transitions from individuals to groups forming new individuals subject to Darwinian mechanisms themselves. Explanations that seek to explain
the emergence of a new level of selection, however, cannot employ properties that would already have to exist on that level for selection to take place. Recently, Hammerschmidt et al. (Nature
515:75–79, 2014) provided a ‘bottom-up’ experiment corroborating much of the theoretical work Paul Rainey has done since 2003 on how cheats can play an important role in the emergence of new Darwinian
individuals on a multicellular level. The aims of this paper are twofold. First, I argue for a conceptual shift in perspective from seeing cheats as (1) a ‘problem’ that needs to be solved for multi-
cellularity to evolve to (2) the very ‘key’ for the evolution of multicellularity. Secondly, I illustrate the consequences of this shift for both theoretical and experimental work, arguing for a more
prominent role of ecology and the multi-level selection framework within the debate then they currently occupy.","Veit, Walter"

Evolutionary
selection has instead favoured mechanisms for rule-based ritualized restraint such as song duel display contests or mark-making practices related to territory. These mechanisms fall within an
escalating fan of agonistic behaviours ranging from avoidance to various forms of non-contact displays and restrained ritualized forms of aggression. This dissertation considers the role of restraint
mechanisms for the prevention of potentially lethal aggression as an evolutionary driver for the development and complexification of hominin communicative abilities, including articulated language and
symbolic cultural practices. ‘Talking,’ ‘singing,’ ‘marking,’ or ‘reading’ oneself –and whole groups– out of potentially lethal aggression offer greater chances of survival than a pattern of
unrestrained ‘all-out’ physical fighting. Studies I and II start out by presenting ethnographical evidence from Galizan case studies of song duels and mark-making practices, which are then presented
in terms of cross-cultural and cross-species comparison. Study III focuses on analogous practices found within the urban Hip-Hop street culture. All three studies present a pattern of formal and
functional continuity of restraint mechanisms across cultures but also across species, indicating a common phylogenetic origin. Gender, age and cultural differences found in the three studies also
point towards a higher relevance of restraint mechanisms in segments of a population that are more likely to engage in potentially lethal aggression (particularly young adult males) and in societies
where the risk of lethal aggression is present. The findings of this dissertation suggest that restrained aggression can serve in certain contexts as a powerful tool for inhibiting escalated and
potentially lethal aggression, with important implications for the design of violence prevention strategies. A revision of policies that imply the disruption of restraint mechanisms is invited.","Pim, Joám Evans"

Three episodes are considered: the adoption of the theory of natural selection, the mathematization of ideas, and
the spread of molecular methods in behavior studies. In these three episodes, students of behavior adopted practices and standards developed in population ecology and population genetics. While they
borrowed tools and methods from these fields, they made distinct uses (inclusive fitness method, evolutionary theory of games, emphasis on individual selection) that set them relatively apart and led
them to contribute, in their own way, to evolutionary theory. These episodes also highlight some limitations of “conjunction narratives” centered on the relation between a discipline and the modern
synthesis. A trend in conjunction narratives is to interpret any development related to evolution in a discipline as an “extension,” an “integration,” or as a “delayed” synthesis. I here suggest that
this can lead to underestimate discontinuities in the history of evolutionary biology.","Grodwohl, Jean-Baptiste"

leading to a feedback loop in the population distribution of predators. We focus our attention on the effects of the segregation of the population of predators into competing, hostile packs on the

ecological functions, I identify three main ways in which functional ecology’s understanding of the function concept diverges from the selected effect theory. Specifically, I argue (1) that functional
ecology conceives ecological functions as context-based rather than history-based properties of organisms; (2) that it attributes to the ecological function concept the aim of explaining ecosystem
processes rather than that of explaining the presence of organisms within ecosystems; and (3) that it conceives the ecological functions of organisms as use and service functions rather than design
functions. I then discuss the extent to which the recently proposed causal role and organizational accounts of ecological functions better accord with the purposes for which the function concept is
used in functional ecology.","Dussault, Antoine C."

fish shoals, smaller bird flocks, and aggregations of disseminating underyearling anuran amphibians and smaller rodents. Very high degrees of similarity of the external phenotypic traits are
characteristic of monospecific fish shoals and smaller bird flocks. Aggregations are adaptive, because they facilitate locomotion and the location of abundant food sources irregularly distributed in
space. The “multiple eyes” effect allows a timely detection of danger. Phenotypic monomorphism, including behavioral, hampers the predator’s choice of prey, often rendering an attack unsuccessful. A
group attack of predators disorganizes the defensive maneuvering of the aggregation and ensures hunting success. The “dilution effect” plays crucial roles in these conditions. The more numerous the
aggregation, the higher the probability of survival of any individual member. The dilution effect is inherent in any aggregation irrespective of the degree of monomorphism of its constituent
organisms, on the assumption of their equal availability to predators. This peculiarity is characteristic of many bird colonies, dispersing young smaller rodents, underyearling anurans leaving their
native pond, etc. Aggregations are adaptations to two very important factors: food supply and defense. The more numerous the aggregation, the higher its adaptive value. Inside an aggregation, the
fitness of all of its members is the same, but the more numerous the aggregation and the greater the dilution, the higher the chances for the survival of any individual. The larger aggregations are
more fit than the less numerous ones. The reproductive success and thus the contributions to abundance of the next generation are higher in larger aggregations. That is what group selection is, groups

In this article, we
provide a concise and comprehensive review of previous studies on evolutionary games and network reciprocity. Subsequently, we evaluate and compare the results from such studies in a unified manner to
answer an open question in evolutionary SPD games: What are the factors underlying network reciprocity and what effect do these factors have on the emergence and promotion of cooperation? As a first
step, we introduce a novel indicator to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness (contribution) of a final fraction of cooperators via the introduction of the associated mechanisms into a simple
evolutionary SPD game. In this game, the players are located on a two-dimensional square lattice with the Moore neighborhood and update their strategies by imitating the strategy of the best
performing player among their neighbors, and the dynamics are separated into two periods: the enduring (END) period and the expanding (EXP) period. The initial fraction of cooperators is decreased
transiently via the invasion and exploitation of defectors in the END period, and over the period, the fraction of cooperators is increased to expand cooperative clusters in the EXP period. Moreover,
we also evaluate the statistical validity of our indicator by performing regression analyses. Our results indicate that two factors bolster the effect of network reciprocity: (1) the shape of the
cooperative cluster (C-cluster) formed in the END period and (2) the ability to expand a single “perfect C-cluster,” which is the smallest patch, to increase the opportunity for interactions between
cooperators and defectors and reduce exploitation by defectors in the EXP period.","Ariful Kabir, K. M. and Tanimoto, Jun and Wang, Zhen"

concept d’individu. Ainsi, la circonscription de ce qui etait apprehende comme appartenant au vivant a ete elargie par la reconnaissance de plusieurs types d’individus biologiques, parmi lesquels nous
trouvons non seulement les organismes dits « traditionnels », mais egalement toute une variete d’entites telles que des protistes, des molecules d’ARN, des prions, des virus et des bacteries de toutes
sortes. Par ailleurs, cette nouvelle vision de l’individu biologique a ete utilisee afin d’illustrer les differents niveaux de l’organisation biologique. En ce sens, la discussion porte principalement
sur le niveau – genes, cellules, organismes, superorganismes, especes, ecosystemes – ou la selection agit, dans lequel l’organisme, en tant qu’exemple paradigmatique d’individu, peut etre considere
comme un simple niveau entre une diversite de niveaux de selection. Par consequent, l’extension des limites de l’ontologie biologique a permis, d’une part, d’interroger le concept d’individu en le
liberant de la reference a l’organisme, et d’une autre, de relativiser l’importance de l’organisme au sein du discours biologique. Pourtant, nous soutenons que, pour contribuer au developpement de la
thematique de l’individu biologique, il faut donner voix a un autre discours sur l’individualite, qui emerge des discussions sur l’ontologie des organismes. C’est vers la tradition systemique qu’il
convient de tourner le regard, dans le but d’etendre les recherches sur la nature de l’individualite biologique sous l’angle d’une definition renouvelee de l’organisme. Notre demarche suppose
d’etablir une distinction importante entre deux tendances biologiques a propos du probleme de l’individu biologique : l’individu darwinien et l’individu ontogenetique. Dans une approche ontogenetique,
un individu correspond a l’entite qui s’autodetermine au cours de son temps de vie individuel. Ainsi, cette position repose sur une conception davantage physiologique, centree sur l’organisation
biologique.","Hernandez, Isaac"

Maternal effects is a classic example of this phenomena, as is

individuals. In such a setting, the breeder's equation no longer holds, as the problem is now a multiple trait one. This chapter examines the theory of response under models with both direct and
associative effects, which can lead to a reversed response (a trait selected to increase instead decreases). The evolution of behavioral traits, including the evolution of altruism, is best handled
using this approach. Further, kin and group selection follow as special cases of the gerenal model under multilevel selection. This chapter also examines how mixed models can be used estimate model

widely discussed in the literature, but advertising researchers have neglected biological nature and biological evolution as additional or alternative explanations for humour in advertising. The paper
contributes to the advertising literature and broadens perspectives for research on humour in advertising by reviewing research on the evolutionary functions of humour, by showing how these functions

products of photosynthesis for selfish replication, while selection at the higher level favors using these products for growth of the entire host/symbiont community. To hold the selfish lower‐level
units in check, mechanisms of conflict mediation must evolve. Fundamental features of photosynthesis have been co‐opted into conflict mediation so that symbionts that fail to export these products
produce high levels of reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. These mechanisms function very well under most environmental conditions, but under conditions particularly detrimental
to photosynthesis, it is these mechanisms of conflict mediation that trigger bleaching.","Blackstone, Neil W. and Golladay, Jeff M."

4,mackiewicz_role_2018,Role of recombination and faithfulness to partner in sex chromosome degeneration,2018-01-01,"Abstract Sex determination in mammals is strongly linked to sex chromosomes. In most cases, females possess two copies of X chromosome while males have one X and one Y chromosome. It is assumed that
these chromosomes originated from a pair of homologous autosomes, which diverged when recombination between them was suppressed. However, it is still debated why the sex chromosomes stopped
recombining and how this process spread out over most part of the chromosomes. To study this problem, we developed a simulation model, in which the recombination rate between the sex chromosomes can
freely evolve. We found that the suppression of recombination between the X and Y is spontaneous and proceeds very quickly during the evolution of population, which leads to the degeneration of the Y
in males. Interestingly, the degeneration happens only when mating pairs are unfaithful. This evolutionary strategy purifies the X chromosome from defective alleles and leads to the larger number of
females than males in the population. In consequence, the reproductive potential of the whole population increases. Our results imply that both the suppression of recombination and the degeneration of
Y chromosome may be associated with reproductive strategy and favoured in polygamous populations with faithless mating partners.","Mackiewicz, Dorota and Posacki, Piotr and Burdukiewicz, Michał and Błażej, Paweł"

For many species, both demographic factors, and inter-
(and intra-) generational information exchange are considered vital ingredients in how movement decisions are reached. Yet key information is often missing on the spatial outcomes of such decisions,
and questions concerning how migratory traditions are influenced by collective memory, density-dependent and density-independent processes remain open. To explore these issues, we focused on Atlantic
herring (Clupea harengus), a long-lived, dense-schooling species of high commercial importance, noted for its unpredictable shifts in winter distribution, and developed a series of Bayesian space-time
occurrence models to investigate wintering dynamics over 23 years, using point-referenced fishery and survey records from Icelandic waters. We included covariates reflecting local-scale environmental
factors, temporally-lagged prey biomass and recent fishing activity, and through an index capturing distributional persistence over time, derived two proxies for spatial memory of past wintering
sites. The previous winter's occurrence pattern was a strong predictor of the present pattern, its influence increasing with adult population size. Although the mechanistic underpinnings of this
result remain uncertain, we suggest that a ‘wisdom of the crowd’ dynamic may be at play, by which navigational accuracy towards traditional wintering sites improves in larger and/or denser, better
synchronized schools. Wintering herring also preferred warmer, fresher, moderately stratified waters of lower velocity, close to hotspots of summer zooplankton biomass, our results indicative of
heightened environmental sensitivity in younger cohorts. Incorporating spatiotemporal correlation structure and time-varying regression coefficients improved model performance, and validation tests on
independent observations one-year ahead illustrate the potential of uniting demographic information and non-stationary models to quantify both the strength of collective memory in animal groups and
its relevance for the spatial management of populations.   This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.","Macdonald, Jed I. and Logemann, Kai and Krainski, Elias T. and Sigurðsson, Þorsteinn and Beale, Colin M. and Huse, Geir and Hjøllo, Solfrid S. and Marteinsdóttir, Guðrún"

Both two-dimensional
foils and three-dimensional rectangular wings of AR  =  2 are examined. In contrast to previous work, two interaction modes distinguished as the coherent and branched wake modes are not observed to be
directly linked to the propulsive efficiency, although they are linked to peak thrust performance and minimum power consumption as previously described (Boschitsch et al 2014 Phys. Fluids 26 051901).
In fact, in closely-spaced propulsors peak propulsive efficiency of the follower occurs near its minimum power and this condition reveals a branched wake mode. Alternatively, for propulsors spaced far
apart peak propulsive efficiency of the follower occurs near its peak thrust and this condition reveals a coherent wake mode. By examining the collective performance, it is discovered that there is an
optimal spacing between the propulsors to maximize the collective efficiency. For two-dimensional foils the optimal spacing of X*  =  0.75 and the synchrony of ϕ  =  2π / 3 leads to a collective
efficiency and thrust enhancement of 42\% and 38\%, respectively, as compared to two isolated foils. In comparison, for AR  =  2 wings the optimal spacing of X*  =  0.25 and the synchrony of ϕ  =  7
π / 6 leads to a collective efficiency and thrust enhancement of 25\% and 15\%, respectively. In addition, at the optimal conditions the collective lateral force coefficients in both the two- and
three-dimensional cases are negligible, while operating off these conditions can lead to non-negligible lateral forces. Finally, the peak efficiency of the collective and the follower are shown to
have opposite trends with increasing spacing in two- and three-dimensional flows. This is correlated to the breakdown of the impinging vortex on the follower wing in three-dimensions. These results
can aid in the design of networked bio-inspired control elements that through integrated sensing can synchronize to three-dimensional flow interactions.","Kurt, Melike and Moored, Keith W"

Among bats, the common vampire bat
(Desmodus rotundus) has likely one of the most complex social structures. Using autosomal and mitochondrial markers on vampires from Mexico, French Guiana, and North Brazil, from both roosting and
foraging areas, we observed an isolation by distance at the wider scale and lower but significant differentiation between closer populations ({\textless}50 km). All populations had a low level of
relatedness and showed deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and a low but significant inbreeding coefficient. The associated heterozygote deficiency was likely related to a Wahlund effect and to
cryptic structures, reflecting social groups living in syntopy, both in roosting and foraging areas, with only limited admixture. Discrepancy between mitochondrial and nuclear markers suggests female
philopatry and higher dispersal rates in males, associated with peripheral positions in the groups. Vampires are also the main neotropical reservoir for rabies virus, one of the main lethal pathogens
for humans. Female social behaviors and trophallaxis may favor a rapid spread of virus to related and unrelated offspring and females. The high dispersal capacity of males may explain the wider
circulation of viruses and the inefficacy of bat population controls. In such opportunistic species, gene connectivity should be considered for management decision making. Strategies such as culling
could induce immigration of bats from neighboring colonies to fill vacant roosts and feeding areas, associated with the dispersal of viral strains.","Huguin, Maïlis and Arechiga-Ceballos, Nidia and Delaval, Marguerite and Guidez, Amandine and de Castro, Isaï Jorge and Lacoste, Vincent and Salmier, Arielle and Setién, Alvaro Aguilar and Silva, Claudia Regina and Lavergne, Anne and de Thoisy, Benoit"
0,heath_recent_2018,Recent trends in evolutionary ethics: greenbeards!,2018-01-01,"In recent years, there has been growing awareness among evolutionary ethicists that systems of cooperation based upon “weak” reciprocity mechanisms (such as tit-for-tat) lack scalability, and are
therefore inadequate to explain human ultrasociality. This has produced a shift toward models that strengthen the cooperative mechanism, by adding various forms of commitment or punishment.
Unfortunately, the most prominent versions of this hypothesis wind up positing a discredited mechanism as the basis of human ultrasociality, viz. a “greenbeard.” This paper begins by explaining what a
greenbeard is, and why evolutionary theorists are doubtful that such a mechanism could play a significant role in explaining human prosociality. It goes on to analyze several recent philosophical
works in evolutionary ethics, in order to show how the suggestion that morality acts as a commitment device tacitly relies upon a greenbeard mechanism to explain human cooperation. It concludes by
showing how some early scientific models in the “evolution of cooperation” literature, which introduced punishment as a device to enhance cooperation, also tacitly relied upon a greenbeard mechanism.","Heath, Joseph and Rioux, Catherine"

in a project that seeks to integrate anthropology with the practices of art, architecture and design. This was also a period during which science increasingly lost its ecological bearings, while the
arts increasingly gained them. Tracing the journey in my own teaching and research, I show how the literary reference points changed, from foundational texts in human and animal ecology, now largely
forgotten, through attempts to marry the social and the ecological inspired by the Marxian revival, to contemporary writing on post-humanism and the conditions of the Anthropocene. For me this has
been an Odyssey – a journey home – to the kind of science imbibed in childhood, as the son of a prominent mycologist. This was a science grounded in tacit wonder at the exquisite beauty of the natural
world, and in silent gratitude for what we owe to this world for our existence. Today’s science, however, has turned wonder and gratitude into commodities. They no longer guide its practices, but are
rather invoked to advertise its results. The goals of science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why, more and more, we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?","Ingold, Tim"

It
is argued that Wynne-Edwards’ proposed revolution failed for two reasons: One is related to the particular notion of group selection he employed, criticized by George Williams, David Lack and others.
The other is the notion of “group” that underlies Wynne-Edwards’ theory: any group of higher animals is a social group, defined by the usual biological standards, but also by the conventions that
regulate its members’ behaviour. If sociality is essential to a biological concept of population, then this means that biology becomes a border science between the natural and the social.","Cernea, Mihail-Valentin"
0,bahar_vanishing_2018,The {Vanishing} {Point} {Appears},2018-01-01,"THE SHARPEST critique of Wynne-Edwards came from George C. Williams, in his 1966 book Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought. Williams was driven by a
distaste for multi-level evolutionary thought that went back to his early years teaching at the University of Chicago in the mid-1950s.  The triggering event may have been a lecture by A. E. Emerson,
a renowned ecologist and termite specialist. The lecture dealt with what Emerson termed beneficial death, an idea that included August Weismann’s theory that senescence was evolved to cull the old and
impaired from populations so that fitter youthful individuals could take their place. My reaction was that if Emerson’s presentation was acceptable biology, I would prefer another calling. (quoted by
Borello 2010, p. 107)  Likewise, Williams’s tone in a letter to David Lack indicates that he considered the idea of group selection rather ridiculous.  You probably had some trouble with the wording
of your discussion of Wynne-Edwards. The subject requires great care to avoid the appearance of sarcasm or ridicule. I know that when I got to that part about the epideictic function of the vertical
movement of plankton [Wynne-Edwards’s Chapter 16] I suddenly wondered if I had fallen for a really elaborate joke.” (quoted by Borello 2010, p. 111)  Williams insisted that adaptations  should be
attributed to no higher a level of organization than is demanded by the evidence. In explaining adaptation, one should assume the adequacy of the simplest form of natural selection, that of
alternative alleles in Mendelian populations, unless the evidence clearly shows that this theory does not suffice. (Williams 1966, pp. 4–5)  Conflating the principle of parsimony with the a focus on
the small, Williams continued his argument in the following terms:  Various levels of adaptive organization, from the subcellular to the biospheric, might conceivably be recognized, but the principle
of parsimony demands that we recognize adaptation at the level necessitated by the facts and no higher. It is my position that adaptation need almost never be recognized at any level above that of a
pair of parents and associated offspring. (Williams 1966, p. 19)","Bahar, Sonya and Bahar, Sonya"

current problems in relationships with spouses, children, coworkers and friends. This phenomenon explains a wide range of pathologies that occur in everyday life that present frequently in
psychotherapy and is often a hidden cause for patients failing to get better. The perspective on pathological identification developed in this article was first described by Joseph Weiss, who noted
that patients unconsciously repeat their parents’ mistakes as a way to protect them and maintain an attachment. This article goes further to suggest that patients may reenact their parents’
problematic behaviors to avoid being aware of what their parents did to avoid their own scornful feelings in response, ultimately to protect parents from potential rejection or abandonment. This
article traces the developing concept of pathological identification by writers including Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, W.R.D. Fairbairn, and Joseph Weiss. It reviews the literature on how children
protect their dysfunctional parents and the important role of altruism and loyalty in creating psychopathology. Based on this conceptualization, psychotherapy can help patients relinquish pathological
identifications. How the therapist can recognize pathological identifications and the implications for treatment technique are illustrated with clinical examples.","Foreman, Steven A."

Theoretical models predict that monogamy, where males and females are

queen); however, little is known about the effects of alate density and flight timing on pairing and colony foundation success. In this study, a positive relationship between alate density and pairing
success was observed in the subterranean termite, Reticulitermes speratus. Upon release of dealates (individuals after shedding wings) every 3 days for 9 days at 10, 20, 40, or 80 pairs/m2/day in a

contexts, from an evolutionary ecological, anthropological and demographic perspective. I start the thesis with a brief history and demographical presentation of how these Tibetan herders behave
within and outside domestic life. The main analysis part starts from which gender get more parental care, by looking at duration of breastfeeding and the interbirth intervals. I find female-biased
parental investment. Possible reasons are the high female workloads and the improved social status of women derived from the high economical contribution made by them. The next analysis focusing on
how wealth flows, the fertility and the length of the trial time affects the stability of marriages. Then I examine the effects of kin on child well-being. Within domestic life, concepts like
‘Grandmother Hypothesis’ and ‘Mother Hypothesis’ are well-documented. While this research makes a contrary finding that it is the older male family members who are invested more in child caring than
the females. The next analysis considers questions beyond domestic life by examining herders’ social networks. I investigate the motivations behind Tibetans who choose to herd in groups, and others
who prefer to herd alone. Economic gift games are used to explore the cooperation strategy within villages, whether pastoralist prefer to share limited resources with their genetic relatives over
others. The analysis concluded that stated social norms are slow to change, while actual individual behaviours appear to evolve faster, responding to recent social and political changes in the region.","Du, Juan"

evolutionary mechanics concept as widely taught and generally understood. However, subsequent discoveries, especially in genetics, have exposed issues with some details of Darwin’s theory that affect
the mechanics of the evolution process and strongly suggest that programmed aging mechanisms in humans and other mammals can and did evolve, and more generally, that a trait that benefits a population
can evolve even if, like senescence, it is adverse to individual members of the population. Evolvability theories contend that organisms can possess evolved design characteristics (traits) that affect
their ability to evolve, and further, that a trait that increases a population’s ability to evolve (increases evolvability) can be acquired and retained even if it is adverse in traditional individual
fitness terms. Programmed aging theories based on evolvability contend that internally limiting lifespan in a species-specific manner creates an evolvability advantage that results in the evolution

However, there is now substantial theoretical and empirical support for the existence of programmed aging in mammals. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to medical research on aging and age-related

other complex organisms, genetically specified senescence mechanisms detect local or temporary external conditions that affect the optimal lifespan for a species population and can adjust the
lifespans of individual members in response. This article describes why lifespan regulation in response to external conditions adds to the evolutionary advantage produced by programmed aging and why a

However, there is still a large gap in our understanding of the
underlying short-term evolutionary processes. Research has shown that differential selection in monoculture vs. mixedspecies communities can lead to rapid evolution. We assessed whether selection
history altered productivity, biodiversity effects and species complementarity within newly assembled monocultures and 2-species mixtures using five plant species selected for twelve years in such a
biodiversity experiment in mixture or monoculture and plants without such a selection history. Plants without past community selection history produced the lowest community biomass and showed the
weakest biodiversity effects. Furthermore, we found that twelve years of selection history in monocultures or species mixtures differentiated plants into monocultureand mixture-types within species.
In newly assembled mixtures, plants with a selection history in mixtures performed better than plants with a monoculture selection history. Biodiversity effects were generally positive but, contrary
to expectation, not stronger for mixture types. In addition, biodiversity effects were both influenced by trait differences among plants and community-weighted means, but these relationships were
largely independent of selection history. Our findings indicate possible mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of adapted subtypes within a species in grasslands. Uncovering these mechanisms
contributes to our understanding of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship, which has the potential to influence species conservation practice.","van Moorsel, Sofia Julia"
7,uppal_shearing_2018,Shearing in flow environment promotes evolution of social behavior in microbial populations,2018-01-01,"How producers of public goods persist in microbial communities is a major question in evolutionary biology. Cooperation is evolutionarily unstable, since cheating strains can reproduce quicker and
take over. Spatial structure has been shown to be a robust mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Here we study how spatial assortment might emerge from native dynamics and show that fluid flow
shear promotes cooperative behavior. Social structures arise naturally from our advection-diffusion-reaction model as self-reproducing Turing patterns. We computationally study the effects of fluid
advection on these patterns as a mechanism to enable or enhance social behavior. Our central finding is that flow shear enables and promotes social behavior in microbes by increasing the group
fragmentation rate and thereby limiting the spread of cheating strains. Regions of the flow domain with higher shear admit high cooperativity and large population density, whereas low shear regions
are devoid of life due to opportunistic mutations. ,  According to the principle of the ‘survival of the fittest’, selfish individuals should be better off compared to peers that cooperate with each
other. Indeed, even though a population of organisms benefits from working together, selfish members can exploit the cooperative behavior of others without doing their part. These ‘cheaters’ then use
their advantage to reproduce faster and take over the population. Yet, social cooperation is widespread in the natural world, and occurs in creatures as diverse as bacteria and whales. How can it
arise and persist then? One idea is that when individuals form distinct groups, the ones with cheaters will perish. Even though a selfish individual will fare better than the rest of its team,
overall, cooperating groups will survive more and reproduce faster; ultimately, they will be favored by evolution. This is called group selection. Here, Uppal and Vural examine how the physical
properties of the environment can influence the evolution of social interactions between bacteria. To this end, mathematical models are used to simulate how bacteria grow, evolve and drift in a
flowing fluid. These are based on equations worked out from the behavior of real-life populations. The results show that flow patterns in a fluid habitat govern the social behavior of bacteria. When
different regions of the fluid are moving at different speeds, ‘shear forces’ are created that cause bacterial colonies to distort and occasionally break apart to form two groups. As such, cooperative
groups will rapidly form new cooperating colonies, whereas groups with cheaters will reproduce slower or perish. Furthermore, results show that when different areas of the fluid have different shear
forces, social cooperation will only prevail in certain places. This makes it possible to use flow patterns to fine tune social evolution so that cooperating bacteria will be confined in a certain
region. Outside of this area, these bacteria would be taken over by cheaters and go extinct. Bacteria are both useful and dangerous to humans: for example, certain species can break down pollutants in
the water, when others cause deadly infections. These results show it could be possible to control the activity of these microorganisms to our advantage by changing the flow of the fluids in which
they live. More broadly, the simulations developed by Uppal and Vural can be applied to a variety of ecosystems where microscopic organisms inhabit fluids, such as plankton flowing in oceanic
currents.","Uppal, Gurdip and Vural, Dervis Can"

but we usually focus on pathogens. When a virus infects a new host species, large changes may occur in pathogen-host ecology and virulence. Some viruses with RNA genomes (e.g. influenza viruses,
henipaviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus) can leap across relatively large host taxa, causing epidemics in the naïve population. This phenomenon is exemplified by changes
in the mode of transmission and virulence of influenza A viruses when they move from waterfowl to chickens, and from chickens to mammals. Increasing virulence is also evident with retroviruses such as
human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and the leukaemia virus of koalas. Viruses with DNA genomes (e.g. poxviruses, herpesviruses and papilloma viruses) usually have a greater fidelity to their host,
but may devastate a closely related host species provided they gain access to it, as when the New World myxomatosis virus was introduced into European rabbits in Australia. Other virulent poxand
herpes virus infections occur when a host species or populations separated by geography and time regain contact through globalisation or through artificial introduction as captive or invasive species.

This thesis focuses on the former, exploring
cooperative dynamics among the Agta, a Filipino hunter-gatherer population. I develop a novel experimental approach to exploring hunter-gatherer cooperative behaviour which simultaneously assesses the
amount individuals cooperate and who they cooperate with. In contrast to much previous experimental literature, this non-anonymous design permits tests of specific theories for the evolution of
cooperation, including: kin selection (cooperating with related individuals); reciprocity (cooperating with others who cooperate in return); and tolerated theft/demand sharing (taking from those with
more resources), among other adaptive hypotheses. Using two experimental games – one exploring giving behaviour (donating resources to others) and another exploring demand sharing behaviour (taking
resources from others) – I find that individuals from camps with a greater probability of repeated interactions give more to and take less from others. When individuals give to others it is directed
towards kin and reciprocating partners, while when individuals take they do so from those with more resources, regardless of kinship or reciprocity. As predicted by theoretical models, this suggests
that reciprocal transfers occur when interactions are repeated, while demand sharing occurs when repeated interactions are less likely. Differences in the frequency of repeated interactions may
therefore explain some cross-cultural variation in forager food-sharing practices. This thesis also explores the effects of reputation on cooperative and interaction networks, finding that many
aspects of forager social networks may reflect the trade of commodities in biological markets. Additionally, assessment of the ontogenetic roots of Agta cooperative behaviour suggests that 3 who
children cooperate with, but not overall levels of cooperation, change over childhood in ways which are consistent with adaptive evolutionary hypotheses. These findings provide an insight into the
evolutionary and ecological roots of hunter-gatherer cooperation.","Smith, D."

Yet despite intense theoretical and empirical work, the details of how group living
arose and is maintained are poorly understood. A central question in this area concerns the strength of natural selection operating between groups of organisms (group selection) because some think
this is key to the evolution of group behaviour. It is, however, challenging to measure natural selection occurring between groups and between the individuals within those groups simultaneously.
Consequently, a number of contentious theoretical issues have plagued group selection research for a number of decades, and empirical work on this topic is often misinterpreted. In this thesis, I
investigate three biological systems that are candidates for group selection where empirical data is readily available. Using techniques from theoretical and computational biology - simulations, game
theory and population genetics - I model evolution occurring at multiple levels simultaneously (multi-level selection), shedding light on the evolution and maintenance of group traits. First, I
consider the evolution of a trait - lateralization - at the population- and colony-level in eusocial organisms, which have a reproductive structure that promotes group organisation and cooperation. I
provide an evolutionary explanation for the strength of lateralization in colonies of the red wood ant, Formica rufa, as a compromise between intraspecific and predatory interactions. After extending
the analysis to involve predators targeting multiple colonies simultaneously, I show that populations should tend towards an equal distribution of left- and right- lateralized colonies, resulting in
zero population-level lateralization. This contradicts the established view that sociality should produce strong levels of lateralization at the population level. Second, I study a sub-social spider,
Anelosimus studiosus, which is a group-living species that has recently been claimed to exhibit group-level adaptation. I use evolutionary game theory to explain the evolution of colony aggression
with individual costs and benefits, providing an alternative to the existing group-level interpretation. The model generates a striking fit to the data without any between-group interactions.
Therefore, I conclude that more evidence is needed to infer group-level adaptation in this colonial spider. Third, I study the Solanaceae, a plant family whose breeding system is reported to have
undergone species selection - group selection acting on whole species. I investigate the evolution of self-fertilization over the family's phylogenetic history. By integrating an existing phylogeny
with models of breeding system evolution at the individual level, I find the average selection pressure - and attendant properties of populations - expected to have characterised the Solanaceae over
{\textasciitilde}36 million years. In conclusion, I have shown the power of modelling approaches to clarify evolutionary explanations, to question existing interpretations, and to identify experiments
that can help researchers identify the true causes of trait evolution.","Calcraft, Paul"

limitations continued to accumulate. More recently, developments, especially in our understanding of biological inheritance, have exposed major issues and complexities regarding the process of
evolution, some of which explicitly enable programmed aging of mammals. Consequently, science-based opposition to programmed aging has dramatically declined. This progression has major implications
for medical research, because the theories suggest that very different biological mechanisms are ultimately responsible for highly age-related diseases that now represent most research efforts and
health costs. Most particularly, programmed theories suggest that aging per se is a treatable condition and suggest a second path toward treating and preventing age-related diseases that can be
exploited in addition to the traditional disease-specific approaches. The theories also make predictions regarding the nature of biological aging mechanisms and therefore suggest research directions.
This article discusses developments of evolutionary mechanics, the consequent programmed aging theories, and logical inferences concerning biological aging mechanisms. It concludes that major medical
research organizations cannot afford to ignore programmed aging concepts in assigning research resources and directions.","Goldsmith, Theodore C."

The unpublished notes of these
conferences—written by Hamilton and recently discovered at the British Library—offer an opportunity to reflect on some of the author’s ideas about evolution. The year of the conference is particularly
significant, as it took place shortly after the applications of the Price equation with which Hamilton was able to build a model that included several levels of selection. In this paper I mainly
analyse the inaugural lecture in which Hamilton proposes a simple model to disprove the hypothesis supported by the British zoologist C. Vero Wynne-Edwards (1906–1997) regarding mechanisms to prevent
“over-exploitation of the food supply” in “the interests of the survival of the group”. The document presented here is of great historical interest. Not only because manuscript offers a model
that—since it was intended for teaching purposes—had never before appeared in the published version, but also because of the general index of the lectures that accompanies it. The latter allows us to
make some hypothetical considerations on the relationship and differences between kin-selection, group-selection and inclusive fitness that Hamilton wanted to present to the attentive, well-prepared
audience of the foreign university that had invited him.","Coco, Emanuele"

traits such as senescence and sex may be due to group selection working against high extinction rates in species that lack senescence and sex. Sometimes, however, reduced extinction rates may evolve
more conventionally by natural selection working to improve the reproductive biology of a species. And sometimes species may evolve to dominate a community’s best habitats even if that evolution
increases its probability of extinction. Despite likely changes at the species level in the probability of extinction, the fossil record suggests that mean extinction rates have not trended much at

reproduction. Such cooperation has been for instance observed within pathogens in the process of infection. Therefore, given the number and the frequency of infectious diseases, understanding the
nature and the dynamics of microbial cooperation may be a crucial step in modern medicine. Microbes often secrete costly enzymes which extracellularly metabolise resources available in the
environment. This external metabolism is a form of ’public good cooperation’, in which individuals invest their energy in producing ’public goods’, available to other organisms. To study this
phenomenon we deploy mathematical models which are based on biologically relevant assumptions. Our models not only aim to capture the dynamics of studied microbial communities, but also to remove the
natural complexity arising in the empirical studies and thus to provide a mechanistic understanding of their results. We first recover and explain the recent empirical finding, about mixed strain
infections, showing that an addition of a low virulent strain which does not produce public goods (termed ’cheat’) may counter-intuitively enhance the total population virulence. What drives this
result turns out to be an interaction of two different cooperative traits and the presence of spatial structure. Next we study the competition between the strains that do and do not produce public
goods. Our results depend on environmental conditions, such as resource concentration and population density, but they are also determined by the degree of spatial structure the ecological trait which
so far has been treated only as a binary variable. Finally, we identify some environmental threats for the external metabolism feeding strategy, and we examine its competitiveness in comparison to
’internal metabolism’, in which the costly enzymes are private.","Pawlowska, Bogna J."

degradation. However, these factors are absent in an increasing number of cases. New research in the Gobi Desert shows that a dramatic change in organizational strategies, including the intensified
use of low-ranked foods from dune-field and wetland habitats, is closely correlated with the establishment of dispersed patches boasting high species diversity and a concentrated abundance of small
prey. According to a global suite of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data, it appears that the fragmentation of more homogeneous grassland habitats coincided with the rise of broad-spectrum
foraging and that these fragmented ecosystems were ideally suited to the unique set of foraging strategies employed by modern Homo sapiens. This study shows how broad-spectrum foraging, increased

Domestic traits, which pass into the wild, are usually negatively selected. Yet, exceptionally, this axiom may fail to apply
if genes, from the domestic animals, increase fertility in the wild. We studied a rare case of a wild boar population under the framework of Wright's interdemic selection model, which could explain
gene flow between wild boar and pig, both considered as demes. We analysed the MC1R gene and microsatellite neutral loci in 62 pregnant wild boars as markers of hybridization, and we correlated
nucleotide mutations on MC1R (which are common in domestic breeds) to litter size, as an evaluation of fitness in wild sow. Regardless of body size and phyletic effects, wild boar sows bearing
nonsynonymous MC1R mutations produced larger litters. This directly suggests that artificially selected traits reaching wild populations, through interdemic gene flow, could bypass natural selection

as “non-Darwinian” because it deviates from the incremental evolution championed by the modern synthesis. Nevertheless, endosymbiosis can be accommodated by a multi-level generalization of
evolutionary theory, which Darwin himself pioneered. The second obstacle is more serious—all of the major features of eukaryotes were likely present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor thus
rendering comparative methods ineffective. In addition to a multi-level theory, the development of rigorous, sequence-based phylogenetic and comparative methods represents the greatest achievement of
modern evolutionary theory. Nevertheless, the rapid evolution of major features in the eukaryotic stem group requires the consideration of an alternative framework. Such a framework, based on the
contingent nature of these evolutionary events, is developed and illustrated with three examples: the putative intron proliferation leading to the nucleus and the cell cycle; conflict and cooperation
in the origin of eukaryotic bioenergetics; and the inter-relationship between aerobic metabolism, sterol synthesis, membranes, and sex. The modern synthesis thus provides sufficient scope to develop

13,moreno_unknown_2016,The {Unknown} {Life} of {Floaters}: {The} {Hidden} {Face} of {Sexual} {Selection},2016-01-01,"Summary. Sexual selection, as a form of social selection based on reproductive resources, is a crucial driver of evolutionary change. Many studies on sexual selection identify potential targets only
within the reproductive fraction of populations. Floaters constitute the non-territorial fraction of the population, according to the usual definitions. Floaters have been identified through
exhaustive capture and marking programmes, removal and nest-box addition experiments, extra-pair paternity studies, acoustic marking and genetic studies. The literature shows that floaters may
represent a considerable fraction of populations, especially among males. There is no clear evidence that size, condition or testosterone level is necessary for explaining floater status generally.
However, the literature suggests that ornament size and expression are involved in territorial exclusion and may be either its cause or one of its consequences. There is some evidence that floaters
survive and reproduce less well than territorials, and that changes from floater to territorial status are accompanied by changes in survival and reproductive rates. However, certain male floaters may
obtain some reproductive success through extra-pair copulations. The possibility that floating constitutes a successful alternative strategy in some species cannot be excluded, although the current
preliminary consensus is that floaters are ‘making the best of a bad job’. Floater status may be imposed by limitations in the availability of mates or breeding space resulting in skewed population
sex ratios, polygamous mating systems, high population densities and increased demand for specific breeding requirements such as space in colonies or adequate nesting cavities. Predictions concerning
the effects of these factors have not been conducted to date. Few studies have been able to clarify the duration of floater status in any population. For short-lived species, floater status in a
single breeding season may in fact imply zero lifetime reproductive success. In males, the existence of a considerable fraction of floaters attempting to breed may select for intense territorial
behaviour and competitive mate guarding tactics in territory holders and in aggressive extrapair copulation and territory acquisition tactics in floaters. Interference competition from floaters may
lead to density-dependent declines in reproductive success. In females, the attempts by floaters to attain breeding opportunities may have contributed to the observed propensities for female
prospecting and for female-female aggression and the signalling of female dominance towards other females. Moreover, there may exist selection in females for signalling quality to mates in order to
avoid being evicted by rivals. Excluding floaters from the analysis of sexually selected traits may severely affect sexual selection estimates because of biased sampling for large or more intensely
expressed ornamentation. The importance of sexual selection may be negated or underestimated when in fact its action on floaters could be maintaining current levels of expression in the territorial
fraction. Existing phenotypes should express, in their morphology, physiology and behaviour, the relentless drive through evolutionary time to avoid becoming a floater.","Moreno, Juan"

evolutionary level. Stable social groups rarely evolve due to competition over food and/or reproduction. Food competition is overcome in social insects with central-place foraging or bonanza-type food
resources, whereas competition over reproduction commonly occurs because staying individuals are rarely sterile. Hence, the evolution of helping is shaped by direct and indirect fitness options and
helping is only altruism if it reduces the helper's direct fitness. The helper's capability to gain direct fitness also creates within-colony conflict. This prevents transition to a new evolutionary
level.","Korb, Judith and Heinze, Jürgen"

constructs such as the Big Five personality model and emotional intelligence (EI). It also demonstrates incremental validity in predicting group leadership, job satisfaction, job self-efficacy, and
commitment. The findings also demonstrate that ES moderates the relationship between individual commitment and group relationship conflict. The results indicate that self-ratings effectively reflect

hierarchical structure in a caged colony of cats (Leyhausen), different territorial patterns in the case of urban cats (Tabor), and egalitarian friendly bonds within the society of a cat shelter

There is extensive redundancy within this body of theory, which has resulted in confusion, and the
links among theories have not been adequately drawn. This review aims to distil the unique ideas from the array of theory related to ecosystem change in response to disturbance. This will help to
reduce redundancy, and improve communication and understanding between researchers. We first outline the broad range of concepts that have developed over the past century to describe community change
in response to disturbance. The body of work spans overlapping succession concepts presented by Clements in 1916, Egler in 1954, and Connell and Slatyer in 1977. Other theories describing community
change include state and transition models, biological legacy theory, and the application of functional traits to predict responses to disturbance. Second, we identify areas of overlap of these
theories, in addition to highlighting the conceptual and taxonomic limitations of each. In aligning each of these theories with one another, the limited scope and relative inflexibility of some
theories becomes apparent, and redundancy becomes explicit. We identify a set of unique concepts to describe the range of mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to disturbance. We present a schematic
model of our proposed synthesis which brings together the range of unique mechanisms that were identified in our review. The model describes five main mechanisms of transition away from a
post‐disturbance community: (i) pulse events with rapid state shifts; (ii) stochastic community drift; (iii) facilitation; (iv) competition; and (v) the influence of the initial composition of a
post‐disturbance community. In addition, stabilising processes such as biological legacies, inhibition or continuing disturbance may prevent a transition between community types. Integrating these six
mechanisms with the functional trait approach is likely to improve the predictive capacity of disturbance theory. Finally, we complement our discussion of theory with a case study which emphasises
that many post‐disturbance theories apply simultaneously to the same ecosystem. Using the well‐studied mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of south‐eastern Australia, we illustrate phenomena
that align with six of the theories described in our model of rationalised disturbance theory. We encourage further work to improve our schematic model, increase coverage of disturbance‐related
theory, and to show how the model may link to, or integrate with, other domains of ecological theory.","Pulsford, Stephanie A. and Lindenmayer, David B. and Driscoll, Don A."
21,ryan_social_2016,Social niche construction and evolutionary transitions in individuality,2016-01-01,"Social evolution theory conventionally takes an externalist explanatory stance, treating observed cooperation as explanandum and the positive assortment of cooperative behaviour as explanans. We ask
how the circumstances bringing about this positive assortment arose in the first place. Rather than merely push the explanatory problem back a step, we move from an externalist to an interactionist
explanatory stance, in the spirit of Lewontin and the Niche Construction theorists. We develop a theory of ‘social niche construction’ in which we consider biological entities to be both the subject
and object of their own social evolution. Some important cases of the evolution of cooperation have the side-effect of causing changes in the hierarchical level at which the evolutionary process acts.
This is because the traits (e.g. life-history bottlenecks) that act to align the fitness interests of particles (e.g. cells) in a collective can also act to diminish the extent to which those
particles are bearers of heritable fitness variance, while augmenting the extent to which collectives of such particles (e.g. multicellular organisms) are bearers of heritable fitness variance. In
this way, we can explain upward transitions in the hierarchical level at which the Darwinian machine operates in terms of particle-level selection, even though the outcome of the process is a
collective-level selection regime. Our theory avoids the logical and metaphysical paradoxes faced by other attempts to explain evolutionary transitions.","Ryan, P. A. and Powers, S. T. and Watson, R. A."

rates of survival and reproduction in different environments (differential fitness). 3. There is a correlation between parents and offspring in the contribution of each to future generations (fitness
is heritable). These three principles embody the principle of evolution by natural selection. While they hold, a population will undergo evolutionary change. It is important to note a certain
generality in the principles. No particular mechanism of inheritance is specified, but only a correlation in fitness between parent and offspring. The population would evolve whether the correlation
between parent and offspring arose from Mendelian, cytoplasmic, or cultural inheritance. Conversely, when a population is at equilibrium under selection (for example, a stable polymorphism due to

predator-prey relationships to intraspecific sociality. Intraspecific aggression is the social equivalent of interspecific competition (101). Since the function of any behavior is not always apparent,
the definition of agonistic behavior is often restricted to the subjects rather than the function of the encounter. The definition of agonistic behavior used here is any combative behavior involving a
struggle or contest among individuals of the same species. Aggression refers to the initiation and attack phases of the agonistic encounter (see 47, p. 333). At the experimental level, operational
definitions replace these general concepts. The purpose of this review is to examine the concept of agonistic behavior as it pertains to ecology. First, a tentative verbal model of the role of
agonistic behavior in ecology is presented as distilled from the relevant literature. Second, specific hypotheses derived from the model are stated (usually at the beginning of paragraphs). Third,
recent tests of the hypotheses are presented and evaluated. Finally, recommendations for further tests are offered. The model and review initially deal with the mechanisms or causes of agonistic
behavior and subsequently with the functions or consequences. 117","King, J. A."

However, for more than a century programmed aging was widely considered to be theoretically
impossible because of the nature of the evolution process. This has resulted in multiple competing non-programmed theories that struggle to explain observations without violating Darwinian
evolutionary mechanics dogma. More recently advances in genetics have exposed major complexities in the evolution process some of which specifically enable adaptive programmed aging. Proponents now
contend that programmed aging theories clearly represent the best science on mammal senescence. However, some proponents of non-programmed theories continue to argue the merits of non-programmed aging
and non-programmed theories are still more popular. This issue is important because the different theories point in very different directions regarding the fundamental nature of mammal aging and
therefore research directions toward treating age-related human diseases. This article is a response to a recent article criticizing programmed aging theories and describes major deficiencies in the

spring migration. Resettlement of males on experimentally vacated territories demonstrated that the new arrivals were potential settlers that normally were excluded from settling by established males,
and these potential settlers were probably not members of a nonbreeding surplus population. Because of the importance to general theory of the existence of surplus populations, it was emphasized that
the existence of potential settlers was necessary but not sufficient evidence that a nonbreeding surplus population existed. The removal experiments demonstrated that the number of breeding males was
normally limited in some habitats by the presence or resistance of established males.-Department of Zoology, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47401, and Department of Zoology, University of
Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602. Present address: Department of Biology, State University College, Geneseo, New York 14454. Accepted 14 July 1975. THE last decade has seen renewed interest in the idea
that territorial behavior may play an important role in limiting the size of breeding bird populations (e.g. Fretwell 1969, Brown 1969, Watson and Moss 1970, Klomp 1972, Maynard Smith 1974). Brown
(1969), Krebs (1971), and Klomp (1972) made the important distinction between the role that territorial behavior may play in limiting the size of an entire species population and its role in limiting
population size on a local scale. Klomp (1972) pointed out that the breeding population as a whole is limited by territorial behavior only if all available habitat is saturated and excluded birds are
forced to join a nonterritorial, or landless, population; on the other hand, if birds are excluded from the most suitable habitats, but not from the less suitable habitats, or if no birds are excluded
from any habitat, the entire species population is not limited by territorial behavior and no nonterritorial surplus occurs. Therefore the demonstration in any species of the existence of unsettled
individuals capable of settling and breeding if given the opportunity takes on considerable importance, for it suggests that landless, surplus birds may be present, which within the framework of
current models implies that the breeding population is limited by territorial behavior (Brown 1969, Watson and Moss 1970, Klomp 1972). It was of great interest, then, when systematic mist netting of
Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens) on a study tract in southern Indiana revealed that unbanded newcomer males and females were caught throughout the breeding season (Thompson and Nolan 1973);
perhaps these birds were potential settlers and members of a surplus population. Further observation established the following (Thompson and Nolan 1973): Only about 30\% of the males and females first
captured after spring migration settled on the area; the rest were transients. Those males that did settle after spring migration established territories in space vacated by males that had failed to
obtain or had lost a mate; and most of the new females replaced other females that had disappeared after their nests failed. Some vacancies created by disappearances were never filled. The
reproductive output of the population was low, and it seemed probable that the study tract was unfavorable chat habitat. In view of the evidence outlined above, the occurrence and status of apparently

Nevertheless, the concept of the holobiont carries an implicit temporal dependency. Similar contingencies can be identified for other ideas, e.g., the notion of a supraorganism. Building on ideas from
computational thermodynamics and information theory leads to the concept of a holobiont-like system. This notion aims at capturing the essentials of a system of interacting biological agents, being
driven by an evolutionary algorithm. The concept can be applied upon several scales, allowing to consider the holobiont sensu stricto as well as full ecosystems. It nicely frames within the metaphor

This thesis is a critical analysis
and recension of one of these applications of evolutionary theory to cultural practice. Specifically, I analyse a secondary case study to investigate the explanatory power and politicoethical
considerations that arise from the application of costly signalling theory to Māori tā moko. Utilising primary and secondary source materials, this research was conducted within an interpretivist and
inductive qualitative framework with the aim of offering a reflexive critique of the explanatory power that costly signalling theory carries for tā moko and, more broadly, of the illustrative efficacy
of evolutionary explanations when applied to indigenous cultural practices. In a critique of the Cisco case study, I identify some of the more general, global deficiencies of evolutionary explanations
of culture and explore the rich, indigenous narrative complexes which shape understandings of Māori tā moko. I maintain that the argument for moko as a costly signal, based, in part, upon Māori
warfare is a reiteration of mythologised aspects of Māori culture which divorces tā moko from its ontological and epistemological underpinnings. In separating it from its Māori context, the
reflexivity of tā moko is denied and Westernised and colonised conceptions of tā moko which etically view Māori cultural practice through a veil of alterity are perpetuated. In response to the
concerns the application of costly signalling theory to tā moko generates, I propose an alternative model: transmissive assemblage. Drawing from actor-network theory, indigenous ontological
perspectivism, and Kaupapa Māori, the transmissive assemblage model provides a symmetrical and decolonised framework which both challenges and enhances the dominant Western scientific paradigms used
to explain indigenous practices. By focussing on the interactions between agents and the associations which circulate between them, rather than on the agents themselves, this integrative model makes
an original contribution to scholarship in allowing the emergence of heteroglossia and by providing a balanced platform for indigenous voices and emic perspectives to be represented in the context of
Western scientific research. In doing so, I argue that integrative, reflexive, and decolonised approaches to indigenous cultural practice which focus on process, as opposed to agency, enhance the
explanatory power of evolutionary explanations by affording indigenous groups the opportunity to assert their own agency within the paradigm of Western science.","Searfoss, Amy Elizabeth Robertson"

Two theoretical frameworks - inclusive fitness and cultural group selection –
have been proposed to explain this evolutionary dilemma. Inclusive fitness theory expects individuals to behave according to an individual fitness maximising strategy, which varies with individual and
ecological parameters. Cultural group selection proposes that inter-group competition permits the evolution of group beneficial traits, such as altruism, through the differential survival and
reproduction of groups. Empirically, a cultural group selection framework has yet to be accurately tested. Studies measuring cooperative behaviour tend to rely on economic games - whose real world
validity is increasingly being questioned - and fail to distinguish between different targets of cooperative behaviour (i.e. out-group, in-group or unbiased). The main aims of this thesis are to
empirically test cultural group selection theories on the evolution of cooperation through inter-group conflict and religion, and to determine how ecological and individual characteristics affect the
variation in cooperative behaviour. I use naturalistic measures of cooperation (donations, lost letters, dropped coins and lost tourist experiments) to quantify the variation in the cooperative
behaviour of Catholics and Protestants - two endogamous groups with an on-going and long history of violent conflict - in a sample of different neighbourhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Overall, I
find that conflict and religiosity do not increase cooperative behaviour towards the in-group, with individual and neighbourhood socio-economic characteristics being the main positive predictors of
cooperation across all the measures. These findings challenge the current cultural group selection perspectives on the origins of human cooperation and highlight the importance of using real world
measures of cooperation to empirically test theories on the evolution of cooperation.","Silva, As"

This paper examines the reasons behind the large population explosion of the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) in Great Britain, which started about 1900, continued for 60–70 years and was
then followed by a decline in numbers. The increase has often been associated with food obtained at landfills, but it is better explained by other causes because such sites were not used for feeding
until the increase had been in progress for 50 years and for less than 20 years before gull numbers started to decline. Further, the flock and frenzy method of feeding used by Herring Gulls at
landfills is not well adapted for the successful exploitation of this food source, and the frequency of use has often been exaggerated. The historic increase in Herring Gulls starting in about 1900
should be attributed to protection and then food acquired from the marine environment, including fishing offal, and increased feeding on agricultural land. Culling has contributed more to the recent
decline of the population than has been previously assessed because of secrecy and lack of detail about many such events. Feeding at landfills may have been detrimental to the Herring Gull population
owing to increased mortality from botulism acquired there. It is concluded that culling and botulism both contributed appreciably to the end of the population explosion that occurred around 1970, and
to the subsequent decline of the Herring Gull in Great Britain. The increase and continued spread of Herring Gulls nesting in urban areas in Great Britain cannot be explained by food obtained within
the towns. Observations that, in some areas, most of these gulls rarely fed at landfill sites, and so avoided botulism, may account for their continued increase in urban areas.","Coulson, John C."

through the lens of the “hologenome”—the collective genomic content of a host and its microbiome. But how symbionts evolve and, particularly, whether they undergo natural selection to benefit hosts
are complex issues that are associated with several misconceptions about evolutionary processes in host-associated microbial communities. Microorganisms can have intimate, ancient, and/or mutualistic
associations with hosts without having undergone natural selection to benefit hosts. Likewise, observing host-specific microbial community composition or greater community similarity among more
closely related hosts does not imply that symbionts have coevolved with hosts, let alone that they have evolved for the benefit of the host. Although selection at the level of the symbiotic community,
or hologenome, occurs in some cases, it should not be accepted as the null hypothesis for explaining features of host–symbiont associations.","Moran, Nancy A. and Sloan, Daniel B."

appropriate sites. Here, we combine climate envelope models with predicted bioclimatic data from two emission scenarios leading up to 2100, to predict European breeding distributions of 23 seabird
species that currently breed in the British Isles. Assuming unlimited dispersal, some species would be “winners” (increase the size of their range), but over 65\% would lose range, some by up to 80\%.
These “losers” have a high vulnerability to low prey availability, and a northerly distribution meaning they would lack space to move into. Under the worst-case scenario of no dispersal, species are
predicted to lose between 25\% and 100\% of their range, so dispersal ability is a key constraint on future range sizes. More globally, the results indicate, based on foraging ecology, which seabird
species are likely to be most affected by climatic change. Neither of the emissions scenarios used in this study is extreme, yet they generate very different predictions for some species, illustrating
that even small decreases in emissions could yield large benefits for conservation.","Russell, Deborah and Wanless, Sarah and Collingham, Yvonne and Huntley, Brian and Hamer, Keith"

evolutionary theory of human warfare. The second is that there is ambiguity about how to interpret existing evidence relating to the evolution of warfare. This paper addresses these problems, first by
outlining an evolutionary theory of human warfare, and second by investigating the veracity of four common claims made against the use of evolutionary theory for explaining warfare. These claims are:
(1) ancestral warfare was not frequent or intense enough to have selected for psychological adaptations in humans for warfare; (2) the existence of peaceful societies falsifies the claim that humans
possess adaptations for fighting; (3) if psychological adaptations for warfare exist, then war is an inevitable and universal component of the human condition; (4) modern warfare and international
politics is so qualitatively different from ancestral politics that any adaptations for the latter are inoperative or irrelevant today. By outlining an evolutionary theory of war and clarifying key
misunderstandings regarding this approach, international relations scholars are better positioned to understand, engage, and contribute to emerging scholarship on human warfare across the social and

conditions; reg ulatory mechanisms employing the feedback principle and striving to level these fluctuations. Accordingly, there are modifying (beyond the control of the popu lation density) and
regulatory (determined by the pop ulation density) ecological factors. The first group of factors can influence living organisms either directly or through changes in the biocenotic components. They
only cause changes in the abundance level, while the regulatory factors maintain it at a particular level corresponding to abiotic environmental conditions. The regulatory density dependent mechanisms

grass grubs (not realising until the 1970s that rye grass monoculture was to blame and DDT actually made the problem worse). When the insecticide was banned in 1968, the Department of Scientific and

in two past environments might have led to strategies that favored altruism and cooperation toward nonkin. First, the expansion of the human brain is seen as requiring long-term, quality parental
investment to sustain it. Altruistic displays could well have signaled an ability and willingness to provide such parental investment in a potential mate and been favored as a result. Second, the
development of extra-somatic weapons is seen as leading to competition within hominin groups becoming more costly as disputes would have become lethal. A cooperative strategy could have achieved
greater net fitness if the benefits of reduced involvement in such lethal disputes exceeded the costs of cooperation. Genes associated with human altruism and cooperation toward nonkin could thus have
increased in frequency and come to be expressed in modern human populations despite the environments in which they evolved no longer being fully evident in the modern world.","Phillips, Tim"

move towards maximizing dispersal of energy, we expect biological diversity to increase towards a level, Dmax, representing maximum entropic production (Smax). Based on this theory, we develop a
mathematical model to predict diversity over the last 500 million years. This model combines diversification, post-extinction recovery and likelihood of discovery of the fossil record. We compare the
output of this model with that of the observed fossil record. The model predicts that life diffuses into available energetic space (ecospace) towards a dynamic equilibrium, driven by increasing
entropy within the genetic material. This dynamic equilibrium is punctured by extinction events, which are followed by restoration of Dmax through diffusion into available ecospace. Finally we compare
and contrast our thermodynamic theory with the MES in relation to a number of important characteristics of evolution (progress, evolutionary tempo, form versus function, biosphere architecture,
competition and fitness).","Skene, Keith"

Life span extension has been achieved by genetic manipulation in multiple organisms including Sarcomyces cervisae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, resulting in more than a
doubling of life span in some cases. Typically, a reduction in function has been the most effective approach to extending life span, and a reduction in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway appears to
provide the most robust increase in life span. This highly conserved pathway integrates growth/survival signals with nutrient status. In mammals, it comprises part of the neuroendocrine axis, a
critical regulator of growth and development. Reduced functionality of the neuroendocrine axis itself promotes life span extension in mammals; however, reduced activity of the IGF-1 signaling pathway

l'opinion publique : la cage qui accueille les combats, le sang et les frappes sur un homme au sol posent des problemes d'acceptation. Ces elements negatifs se retrouvent dans les representations
sociales et individuelles, chez les reponses des enquetes qu'ils soient inities ou non-inities aux pratiques de combat hybride. En France, la competition de MMA n'est pas autorisee alors que les clubs
l'enseignent aupres de pratiquants de plus en plus nombreux. Les arts martiaux mixtes reunissent les contraires : une alterite fondee sur l'utilisation de l'agression instrumentale potentiellement
destructrice, une reciprocite violente, mais socialisatrice et un sport « viril » capitaliste qui se nourrit du liberalisme et du debridement du pouvoir etatique. Pris dans un contexte post-moral,
l'exteriorisation d'une violence dans le MMA est a contre-courant du processus de pacification que la societe connait, associe a la quete de securite. Enfin, l'engagement corporel intense de ce sport
ne correspond pas au culte du corps en bonne sante qui predomine desormais. De ce fait, cette discipline questionne sur la place des sports-spectacles violents au sein d'une societe pacifiee.","Ramirez, Yann"

There is an important difference between breeding (Darwin’s role model of evolution) and evolution itself: while in breeding the final goal is
preset and constant, adaptation to varying biotic and abiotic environmental conditions is a moving target and selection can be highly fluctuating. Evolution is a cybernetic process whose Black Box can
be understood as learning automaton with separate input and output channels. Cybernetics requires a closed signal loop: action by the system causes some change in its environment and that change is
fed to the system via information (feedback) that enables the system to change its behavior. The input signal is given by a complex biotic and abiotic environment. Natural selection is the
output/outcome of the learning automaton. Environments are stochastic. Particularly, densityand frequency-dependent coevolutionary interactions generate chaotic and unpredictable dynamics. Stochastic
environments coerce organisms into risky lotteries. Chance favors the prepared. The ‘Law of Requisite Variety’ holds that cybernetic systems must have internal variety that matches their external
variety so that they can self-organize to fight variation with variation. Both conservative and diversifying bet-hedging are the risk-avoiding and -spreading insurance strategies in response to
environmental uncertainty. The bet-hedging strategy tries to cover all bases in an often unpredictable environment where it does not make sense to “put all eggs into one basket”. In this sense,
variation is the bad/worst-case insurance strategy of risk-aversive individuals. Variation is pervasive at every level of biological organization and is created by a multitude of processes:
mutagenesis, epimutagenesis, recombination, transposon mobility, repeat instability, gene expression noise, cellular network dynamics, physiology, phenotypic plasticity, behavior, and life history
strategy. Importantly, variation is created condition-dependently, when variation is most needed – in organisms under stress. The bet-hedging strategy also manifests in a multitude of life history
patterns: turnover of generations, reproductive prudence, iteroparity, polyandry, and sexual reproduction. Cybernetic systems are complex systems. Complexity is conceived as a system’s potential to
assume a large number of states, i.e., variety. Complex systems have both stochastic and deterministic properties and, in fact, generate order from chaos. Non-linearity, criticality, self-
organization, emergent properties, scaling, hierarchy and evolvability are features of complex systems. Emergent properties are features of a complex system that are not present at the lower level but
arise unexpectedly from interactions among the system’s components. Only within an intermediate level of stochastic variation, somewhere between determined rigidity and literal chaos, local
interactions can give rise to complexity. Stochastic environments change the rules of evolution. Lotteries cannot be played and insurance strategies not employed with s ing le ind iv idua ls . These
are emergent population-level processes that exert population-level selection pressures generating variation and diversity at all levels of biological organization. Together with frequency and
density-dependent selection, lotteryand insurance-dependent selection act on population-level traits. The duality of stochasticity and selection is the organizing principle of evolution. Both are
interdependent. The feedback between output and input signals inextricably intertwines both stochasticity and natural selection, and the individualand population-levels of selection. Sexual
reproduction with its generation of pre-selected variation is the paradigmatic bet-hedging enterprise and its evolutionary success is the selective signature of stochastic environments.Sexual
reproduction is the proof of concept that (epi)genetic variation is no accidental occurrence but a highly regulated process and environmental stochasticity is its evolutionary “raison
d’être”.Evolutionary biology is plaqued by a multitude of controversies (e.g. concerning the level of selection issue and sociobiology. Almost miraculously, these controversies can be resolved by the
cybernetic model of evolution and its implications.","Heininger, K."

non-living. Microevolutionary thought associates with the study of how genetic selection explains higher-order phenomena such as speciation and extinction, while macroevolutionary research fields
understand species and higher taxa as biological individuals and they attribute evolutionary causation to biotic and abiotic factors that transcend genetic selection. The microreductionist and
macroholistic research schools are characterized as two distinct epistemic cultures where the former favor mechanical explanations, while the latter favor historical explanations of the evolutionary

ratio evolution and the principle of a density-dependent trade-off between offspring number and offspring quality. His contribution to the subject long remained unknown since he withdrew them from the
second and final edition of the book (1874). This is the biggest change in Darwin’s lifelong reflection on evolutionary mechanisms. Why did this scrupulous and prudent scientist once decide to publish
these views, then to reject them 3 years later? I will review the reasons he became interested in the issue, the status he gave to the question in his thinking, and the probable reasons he was
eventually dissatisfied with the solution he found. I will also consider the status of another of Darwin’s hypotheses, with which he was dissatisfied in relation to this question: that of a reciprocal
sexual choice between the most vigorous males and the most vigorous females. Darwin’s solution to sex ratio evolution was independently discovered in 1930 by Fisher, but it was not until 1984 that
Darwin’s priority was acknowledged. I will show that Darwin’s solution went further than so-called Shaw-Mohler’s demonstration in 1953. I will also raise the issue of density-dependent selection,
which appeared in contemporary evolutionary biology in 1971 but which was clearly addressed, a century earlier, in the same section of the first edition of The Descent of Man.","Veuille, Michel"

Alongside the plenitude of empirical data on invasive species there exists an equally broad
range of mathematical models that might be of use in understanding biological invasions. This thesis aims to address several issues related to modelling invasive species and provide insight into their
dynamics. Part I (Chapter 2) documents a case study of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, invasion in the US. We propose an alternative hypothesis to explain the patchiness of gypsy moth spread
entailing the interplay between dispersal, predation or a viral infection and the Allee e ect. Using a reaction-di usion framework we test the two models (prey-predator and susceptible-infected) and
predict qualitatively similar patterns as are observed in natural populations. As high density gypsy moth populations cause the most damage, estimating the spread rate would be of help in any
suppression strategy. Correspondingly, using a di usive SI model we are able to obtain estimates of the rate of spread comparable to historical data. Part II (Chapters 3, 4 and 5) is more
methodological in nature, and in a single species context we examine the e ect of an ubiquitous phenomenon in uencing population dynamics time delay. In Chapter 3 we show that contrary to the general
opinion, time delays are not always destabilising, using a delay di erential equation with discrete time delay. The concept of distributed delay is introduced in Chapter 4 and studied through an
integrodi erential model. Both Chapters 3 and 4 focus on temporal dynamics of populations, so we further this consideration to include spatial e ects in Chapter 5. Using two di erent representations
of movement, we show that the onset of spatiotemporal chaos in the wake of population fronts is possible in a single species model.","Jankovic, M."

1978). Gulls nesting in three different habitats (designated puffin, rocky, and meadow) were compared with regard to several reproductive parameters. More pairs were found to nest in rocky habitat,
and fewer pairs were found to nest in puffin habitat, than would be expected from a random distribution. In 1977, a year of low food availability, pairs in rocky habitat laid and hatched eggs
significantly earlier than in the other two habitats. In 1978, when food was more abundant, gulls in rocky habitat laid heavier eggs than their counterparts in the other habitats. In both 1977 and
1978, chicks from rocky habitat grew at the fastest rate and were heavier than chicks in the other habitats. Finally, results of an experiment to test the egg-production capacity of females
demonstrated that female gulls in rocky habitat were capable of producing significantly more eggs than their counterparts in meadow and puffin habitats. Despite the apparently better condition of
gulls in rocky habitat, however, Herring Gull pairs in puffin habitat fledged as many chicks per nest as pairs in rocky habitat in 1977 and 1978, and even fledged more chicks in 1976. In all 3 yr of
study, gulls in meadow habitat fledged the fewest chicks per nest. Within habitats, chick survival was strongly correlated with early laying dates and high rates of growth. However, there was also a
large residual effect which was probably due to differences in the habitats. These differences are probably due to crowding and socially induced mortality in rocky habitat, and to the presence of
predatory Great Black-backed Gulls in meadow habitat. The results support the theoretical models for habitat selection and dispersion developed by Fretwell and Lucas (1970), which suggest that
increasing density in a preferred habitat can create a situation whereby fitness may actually be greater in a less-preferred habitat.","Newfoundland, Gull IN"

This means that to understand evolutionary political economy one must understand the nature of the evolutionary
process in its full complexity. From the time of Darwin and Spencer natural selection has been seen as the foundation of evolution. This view has remained even as views of how evolution operates more
broadly have changed. An issue that some have viewed as an aspect of evolution that natural selection may not fully explain is that of emergence of higher order structures, with this aspect having
been associated with the idea of emergence. In recent decades it has been argued that self-organization dynamics may explain such emergence, with this being argued to be constrained, if not
overshadowed, by natural selection. Just as the balance between these aspects is debated within organic evolutionary theory, it also arises in the evolution of political economy, as between such
examples of self-organizing emergence as the Mengerian analysis of the appearance of commodity money in primitive societies and the natural selection that operates in the competition between firms in

evolutionary benefit. Modern non-programmed theories contend that mammal aging generally results from natural deteriorative processes, and that lifespan differences between species are explained by
differences in the degree to which they resist those processes. Originally proposed in the 19th century, programmed aging in mammals has historically been widely summarily rejected as obviously
incompatible with the mechanics of the evolution process. However, relatively recent and continuing developments described here have dramatically changed this situation, and programmed mammal aging
now has a better evolutionary basis than non-programmed aging. Resolution of this issue is critically important to medical research because the two theories predict that very different biological
mechanisms are ultimately responsible for age-related diseases and conditions.","Goldsmith, Theodore C."

Typical
life history traits discussed in the classic evolutionary biology literature include size at birth, growth pattern, age of sexual maturation, size at maturity, age of first reproduction, number and
sex ratio of offspring produced, age and size-specific reproductive investments, age and size-specific mortality schedules, and length of lifespan (see Stearns, 1992). A basic assumption of the
classic optimality approach to life history theory is that, given adequate genetic variation, the evolution of species has involved natural selection of optimal combinations of these traits. However,
genetic and other constraints, and trade-offs have reduced the set of possible combinations. Life history theory predicts trade-offs between energetic investment in growth, maintenance, and
reproduction across species, of which a trade-off between the main constituents of reproductive investment, mating and parental effort, may be the most common (McGlothlin, Jawor, \& Ketterson, 2007).
It is easy to see how if organisms possess finite resources that trade-offs affecting life history traits would necessarily evolve over evolutionary time. If the “pie of finite resources” is divided
up between life history traits, taking a large slice of one type of trait leaves less of the pie to be divided into other forms of investment. Among vertebrate species, for example, salmon have very
different life histories than primate species. Their life history consists of relatively rapid growth, early maturation and first reproduction, small size, little parental care, and the production of
a high number of offspring, followed immediately by death in semelparous species,eclipsing a postreproductive period. In contrast, the life history of human beings consists of relatively slow
development, late puberty and first reproduction, iteroparity, large body size, low number of offspring, followed by high parental investment (extended to grandparental investment) and a long life
span, including a female postreproductive period.","Surbey, Michele K."

decades. Here, we first review the genesis of, and support for, the major ecological hypotheses for biparental sexual reproduction. We then focus on the idea that host–parasite coevolution can favour
cross‐fertilization over uniparental forms of reproduction, as this hypothesis currently has the most support from natural populations. We also review the results from experimental evolution studies,
which tend to show that exposure to novel environments can select for higher levels of sexual reproduction, but that sex decreases in frequency after populations become adapted to the previously novel
conditions. In contrast, experimental coevolution studies suggest that host–parasite interactions can lead to the long‐term persistence of sex. Taken together, the evidence from natural populations
and from laboratory experiments point to antagonistic coevolution as a potent and possibly ubiquitous force of selection favouring cross‐fertilization and recombination.","Lively, C. M. and Morran, L. T."

Conceptual separation of the process of
living from the process of evolution has heuristic value, with the potential to ask better questions about both. Following a short account of the origin of this collection of essays, the first main
part of the paper assesses current ideas about the nature of living systems. Becausee all known taxa apparently constitute a single, monophyletic group (superdomain Biota), life can only be
characterized, not defined. The second part reviews the ten papers that, collectively, comprise this special issue. It is concluded that we need to acknowledge both the ‘processes of life’ and the
‘processes’ of evolution and we need to explore the consequences that flow from making this distinction. Behaviour, in its broadest sense, is seen as both the expression and mediator of organismic
agency, and must therefore play a key role in the processes of evolution. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 219–241.","Vane-Wright, R. I."
21,zaggl_eleven_2014,Eleven mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation,2014-01-01,"Abstract: Cooperation is one of the basic elements of social life. It is essential for emergent social phenomena, such as the formation of families, groups, and societies. However, evolutionary forces
counter cooperation. The trait of supporting others is dominated by selfish behavior. In the last few decades scientists, in particular biologists, achieved extraordinary progress regarding the
question of how cooperation is possible despite of evolutionary forces. This produced an enormous amount of literature. This paper identifies and reviews the known solutions explaining cooperation
under evolutionary forces. Using bibliometric methods in combination with extant review articles and traditional reviewing of original literature, it is possible to isolate 11 mechanisms of
cooperation under the conditions of evolution. Developing a categorization of the mechanisms according to shared characteristics establishes a fundamental framework for institutional and mechanism
design activities. Implications for future research paths are identified, in particular for the mechanism of indirect reciprocity.","Zaggl, Michael A."

call it the Fisher-Darwin model. However, Fisher was not influenced by Lamarckian views on the evolution of social insects that were common at that time. The Fisher-Darwin model presages almost

Many organisms adopt one of two distinct dispersal tactics at reproduction: the production of small offspring that can disperse over long distances
(such as seeds and spawned eggs), or budding. The latter is observed in some colonial organisms, such as clonal plants, corals and ants, in which (super)organisms split their body into components of
relatively large size that disperse to a short distance. Contrary to the common dispersal viewpoint, short-dispersal colonial organisms often flourish even in environments with frequent disturbances.
In this paper, we investigate the conditions that favor budding over long-distance dispersal of small offspring, focusing on the life history of the colony growth and the colony division ratio. These
conditions are the relatively high mortality of very small colonies, logistic growth, the ability of dispersers to peacefully seek and settle unoccupied spaces, and small spatial scale of
environmental disturbance. If these conditions hold, budding is advantageous even when environmental disturbance is frequent. These results suggest that the demography or life history of the colony
underlies the behaviors of the colonial organisms.","Nakamaru, Mayuko and Takada, Takenori and Ohtsuki, Akiko and Suzuki, Sayaki U. and Miura, Kanan and Tsuji, Kazuki"

Here we use the
diffusion approximation of population genetics to study analytically the steady-state properties of such a prebiotic scenario. The coexistence of distinct template types inside a protocell is achieved
by a selective pressure at the protocell level (group selection) favoring protocells with a mixed template composition. In the degenerate case, where the templates have the same replication rate, we
find that a vanishingly small migration rate suffices to eliminate the segregation effect of random drift and so to promote coexistence. In the nondegenerate case, a small migration rate greatly
boosts coexistence as compared with the situation where there is no migration. However, increase of the migration rate beyond a critical value leads to the complete dominance of the more efficient
template type (homogeneous regime). In this case, we find a continuous phase transition separating the homogeneous and the coexistence regimes, with the order parameter vanishing linearly with the
distance to the transition point.","Fontanari, José F. and Serva, Maurizio"

a tension between these two forces, because, more often than not, what is good for the individual is bad for the group, and what is good for the group is bad for the individual. In this dissertation,
I argue that in order to resolve this tension between individual and group good, humans have evolved to utilise social contracts - sets of rules that structure interactions within our societies. These
contracts, I argue, emerged in our hunter-gatherer ancestry as a means of solving problems surrounding their most basic and most important economic activity - food sharing. Once we became adapted to

twentieth century, evolutionary biologists and economists developed parallel theories of rationality, the gene’s eye view and rational choice theory, which imagine humans as self-interested
individuals maximizing consumption of scarce resources. When rational choice theory was applied to agricultural development in the Green Revolution programs of the 1940s to the 1980s, it turned
otherwise cooperative farmers into competitors for cash profits, resulting in a process akin to differential mortality, generating wealth for some but exacerbating poverty for many. I suggest that
evolutionary biology may offer an alternative view of human rationality, one consistent with ethnographic evidence of farmers’ behavior. One emerging candidate for a “Rationality 2.0” assumes cultural
inheritance, cultural group selection, strong reciprocity, and bounded rationality. Farmers make decisions that balance individual benefits with family and community well-being. While the new Alliance

prominent detachment flake scar and are relatively rare in the archaeological record. A sample of Clovis points from the central Great Plains is analyzed to determine the frequency and significance of
points that maintain this flake scar relative to typical points. The origin of the raw material for the two subsets of points is also investigated, and this reveals that more Clovis projectile points
are manufactured on flakes with little additional retouch as the distance from the lithic source increases. This suggests that Clovis points on flakes represent a technological adaptation of central

0,woodberry_evolutionary_2014,Evolutionary biology in silico: explorations of adaptation in artificial populations,2014-01-01,"The complexity, detail and diversity of life has intrigued and excited both scientist and layperson alike. How such intricate design, as that commonly found in biological life, could have come about
is the subject of millennia of thought. Charles Darwin’s (1859) theory of evolution (co-discovered by Alfred Wallace) proposes a simple mechanism of change across generations, and provides a testable
explanation of such design. Although united on the validity of evolution, scientists remain divided on many open questions, including the adaptive nature of traits that benefit the group at the cost
of individual fitness — that is, biological altruism. Interpreting the progress of evolutionary history from the fossil record is fraught with challenges. The large gaps between fossilization events
hide the transitions between species, and much of the details of the organisms themselves are lost in the process. While we can conduct experiments on living organisms in the laboratory, the temporal
and spatial scales involved in evolution in nature do not lend themselves to easily controllable and repeatable experiments. The recent field of artificial life (ALife) (Langton, 1989) provides new
exciting potentials for experimental exploration of evolution. Within the software medium we can create simulations of populations of artificial organisms, which are subject to evolutionary forces,
existing in an artificial environment, competing with each other for the opportunity to survive and reproduce. By incorporating such simulation techniques into the studies of evolutionary biology we
greatly enhance our experimental repertoire. In this thesis I show that ALife provides new experimental techniques to explore open questions in evolutionary biology. In particular, I consider
questions on the adaptive nature of groups and biological altruism. Firstly, I examine the relationship between the two popular explanations of altruism, group and kin selection, demonstrating a
common dependence on inclusive fitness (Hamilton, 1964). Next, I investigate an extreme form of biological altruism, genetically programmed aging. Commonly thought to be non- adaptive (Medawar, 1952;
Williams, 1957; Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979), I develop my own hypothesis of adaptive aging for the sake of group diversity, confirming it in simulated worlds of hosts and parasites. Lastly, I test,
and find support for, Eldredge and Gould’s (1972) claim that punctuated equilibrium, a pervasive phenomena in the fossil record, provides the foundations for a species/group selection mechanism.","Woodberry, O."

whole, entire, and entirety. Third, the term hologenome parallels the accepted term holobiont. What is the relationship between the hologenome concept and the classical phenomenon of symbiosis? The
term symbiosis was first coined by Anton de Bary (1879) in the nineteenth century as ‘‘the living together of different species.’’ His broad definition is still generally accepted. The symbiotic
system is usually constructed from a large partner termed the host and smaller partners called symbionts. This arbitrary division by dimension between host and symbiont may not fit all systems because
size can be measured by cell number or by genome size, and in the case of many symbioses the microorganisms both outnumber their host and contain more genetic information. In spite of these
limitations, the definition of host and symbiont based on size continues to be widely used, although it would be more appropriate to consider both the host and symbionts as constituents of the
holobiont. Among the symbionts one finds endosymbionts and exosymbionts, referring to microrganisms living inside or outside host cells, respectively. Symbioses can also take many forms; most of them
are defined as different levels of mutualism, when both the host and the symbiont benefit from the interaction. When the symbiont benefits and the host suffers damage, symbiosis is termed parasitism
(or pathogenesis). Commensalism is accepted to be a close association of two or more dissimilar organisms where the association is advantageous to one and does not affect the other(s). These types of
symbioses may change under different circumstances, for example, parasitic microorganisms can become beneficial under different circumstances (Taylor et al. 2005). The hologenome concept presents a
novel way of looking at symbiosis. Until recently most of the important research on symbiosis has been carried out with a small number of model systems involving a host and a single primary symbiont,
e.g., aphids and their endosymbiotic bacterium Buchnera sp (Wilson et al. 2010), the squid light organ and Vibrio fischeri (Nyholm and McFall-Ngai 2004), hard corals and their photosynthetic microalga

competition, permitting coexistence with other social insect species. In other words, kin selection—a form of intra-population dynamics—might enhance the species richness of the community, a higher-
level structure. The converse effect, from higher to lower levels, might also operate, whereby strong interspecific competition may limit the evolution of selfish individual traits. If the latter
effect were to prove more important, it would challenge the common view that intra-population dynamics (via individual or gene selection) is the main driver of evolution.","Tsuji, Kazuki"

polymorphism and sterility in social insects. Hamilton further explored the roles of inclusive fitness and reciprocation to tackle Darwin's other difficulty, the evolution of human altruism. The

To investigate the effects of progeny
production on reproductive and somatic aging, we conducted longitudinal studies of Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites. For mated wild-type animals that were not sperm limited and survived past the
end of the reproductive period, high levels of cross-progeny production were positively correlated with delayed reproductive and somatic aging. In this group of animals, individuals that generated
more cross progeny also reproduced and lived longer than individuals that generated fewer cross progeny. These results indicate that progeny production does not accelerate reproductive or somatic
aging. This longitudinal study demonstrated that cumulative cross progeny production through day four is an early-stage biomarker that is a positive predictor of longevity. Furthermore, in mated
animals, high levels of early cross progeny production were positively correlated with high levels of late cross progeny production, indicating that early progeny production does not accelerate
reproductive aging. The relationships between progeny production and aging were further evaluated by comparing self-fertile hermaphrodites that generated relatively few self progeny with mated
hermaphrodites that generated many cross progeny. The timing of age-related somatic degeneration was similar in these groups, suggesting progeny production does not accelerate somatic aging. These
studies rigorously define relationships between progeny production, reproductive aging, and somatic aging and identify new biomarkers of C. elegans aging. These results indicate that some mechanisms

only to higher, social mammals. We propose that post-reproductive life span evolves to stabilize predator-prey population dynamics, avoiding local extinctions. In the absence of senescence, juveniles
would be the most susceptible age class. If juveniles are the first to disappear when predation pressure is high, this amplifies the population’s risk of extinction. A class of older, senescent
individuals can help shield the juveniles from predation, stabilizing demographics and avoiding extinction. If, in addition, the life history is arranged so that the older individuals are no longer

group benefits will lead to the evolution of cooperation. We analyze a microbial social trait to precisely define the conditions favoring cooperation. We combine the multilevel partition of the Price
equation with a laboratory model system: swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We parameterize a population dynamics model using competition experiments where we manipulate expression, and therefore the
cost‐to‐benefit ratio of swarming cooperation. Our analysis shows that multilevel selection can favor costly swarming cooperation because it causes population expansion. However, due to high costs and
diminishing returns constitutive cooperation can only be favored by natural selection when relatedness is high. Regulated expression of cooperative genes is a more robust strategy because it provides

32,cao_high_2013,High social density increases foraging and scouting rates and induces polydomy in {Temnothorax} ants,2013-01-01,"Many organisms live in crowded groups where social density affects behavior and fitness. Social insects inhabit nests that contain many individuals where physical interactions facilitate information
flow and organize collective behaviors such as foraging, colony defense, and nest emigration. Changes in nest space and intranidal crowding can alter social interactions and affect worker behavior.
Here, I examined the effects of social density on foraging, scouting, and polydomy behavior in ant colonies—using the species Temnothorax rugatulus. First, I analyzed field colonies and determined
that nest area scaled isometrically with colony mass—this indicates that nest area changes proportionally with colony size and suggests that ants actively control intranidal density. Second,
laboratory experiments showed that colonies maintained under crowded conditions had greater foraging and scouting activities compared to the same colonies maintained at a lower density. Moreover,
crowded colonies were significantly more likely to become polydomous. Polydomous colonies divided evenly based on mass between two nests but distributed fewer, heavier workers and brood to the new
nests. Polydomous colonies also showed different foraging and scouting rates compared to the same colonies under monodomous conditions. Combined, the results indicate that social density is an
important colony phenotype that affects individual and collective behavior in ants. I discuss the function of social density in affecting communication and the organization of labor in social insects
and hypothesize that the collective management of social density is a group level adaptation in social insects.","Cao, Tuan T."

boost the welfare of other organisms, which we might call benefit-delivery devices. Benefit-delivery devices come in two broad types: (a) Those that evolve because the genes that assemble them during
ontogeny increase the direct reproductive success of the organism in whom those genes reside, and (b) those that evolve because the genes that assemble them during ontogeny increase the reproductive
success of exact replicas of those genes that reside in other organisms (most recognizably, in the organism’s genetic relatives). In this paper, we catalogue some of the benefit-delivery devices with

Selection debate, spanning both the biological and the philosophical literature and including the impassioned group-selection debate. Why do these two discourses exist separately, and interact
relatively little? We postulate that the reason for this schism can be found in the differing focus of each controversy, a deep difference itself determined by distinct general styles of scientific
research guiding each discourse. That is, the Wright–Fisher debate focuses on adaptive process, and tends to be instructed by the mathematical modeling style, while the focus of the Units of Selection
controversy is adaptive product, and is typically guided by the function style. The differences between the two discourses can be usefully tracked by examining their interpretations of two contested

processes lead to emergence of global hierarchies that emerge from local interactions leading to self-organizing dynamics. The analysis starts with the evaluation of the degree to which evolutionary
processes operate at levels higher than the gene or organism, and proposes a parallel with the search for satisfactory and realistic microfoundations to macroeconomics rather than a mere assumption
that the macro simply mimics what goes on at the micro level. The question is how multiple levels can emerge in a self-organizing way from the lower levels and the role of adaptation and natural
selection in this emergence. While advocates of self-organization argue that natural selection plays a central role in these processes, doubters see an invocation of mystical or even theological
processes that stand aside from a proper understanding of the operation of natural selection. These debates remain unresolved, even as the trend may be favoring the advocates of a carefully developed
multi-level selection approach in conjunction with a carefully formulated version of dynamic self-organization may be gaining more favor over time. However, it is a matter of fact that many recent
economic models where economic agents are assumed to be boundedly rational and heterogeneous are often represented as myopic, interacting, adaptive and evolving systems, leading to long-run emerging

of persons working in the areas that today are called behavioral ecology or sociobiology was miniscule. Roughly half a dozen names spring to mind; today, perhaps 200. Second, it happened
serendipitously that a basic concept that was developed in primitive form in the 1964 paper, the idea of 'economic defendability,' proved to have heuristic value for some beautiful empirical studies
done later on the energetic costs and benefits of territorial behavior by Wolf, Gill, Carpenter, and others.These studies attracted attention to the 1964 paper. The 'economic' approach is now widely
used in behavioral ecology. ""When it was written, the subject of this paper was far removed from my research interests, which then were in the new field of neuro-ethology. It would not have been
written at all except for a coincidence of two events, one scientific and one personal. In 1962, a heavy book appeared that misinterpreted nearly all of animal social behavior according to the theory
of interdemic selection, instead of the conventional individual selection. Territorial behavior was the principal test case. Believing that a response was required because many naive readers would be
swayed by the 'weight' of evidence for interdemic selection, I felt that two avenues of response were open, to reinterpret all the evidence in the book, or to present a brief and simple statement of
the alternative approach. I chose the latter. Although this approach was widely known, it had not previously been set down succinctly in one publication. My version of it was, I thought, conventional
and unoriginal. I suspect that others would have soon written similar thoughts had I not responded so promptly. ""I would not have troubled to write the 1964 paper had I been immersed in research in
October 1962. By chance, however, I was caught in a slack period. I had just arrived at a new campus for my first academic job, and I was waiting for some electronic equipment to arrive to begin my
experiments in avian neuro-ethology. I had already written up my graduate and postdoctoral work and was waiting for responses from coauthors. This left me with time to read and write about anything
that came to mind. ""In graduate school, 1952-1960, I had moved from a background in evolutionary biology and systematics into the relatively new areas of ecology and behavior. My interest in the
action of natural selection on territorial behavior was a logical outgrowth of this combination. An excellent review of recent work in this area has been provided by Wittenberger's new book, Animal

interaction (or simply of co-existence) between individuals (see Courchamp et al. 2008, for an overview of Allee’s work and its influence). His studies, primarily on fish, emphasized the role of
cooperation in promoting animal survival under conditions of stress or scarcity. In works such as The Social Life of Animals (1938), where he compiled the results of studies from many other
laboratories in addition to his own, Allee demonstrated again and again that, while competition clearly occurs in nature, cooperation provides an important balancing tendency. He emphasized that,
while under many conditions overcrowding could be deleterious to a population, under other circumstances undercrowding could be equally detrimental. This phenomenon is now known as the Allee effect,
and appears regularly in nonlinear models of population dynamics, as well as in experimental studies ranging from the mating behavior of wild dogs to quorum sensing in the formation of bacterial

attempts to explain biological phenomena often lacked sophistication. Now that several recent works have called attention to the complex relationship between biological individuality and the levels of
selection, we believe it will prove instructive to revisit these early-twentieth-century biologists and reassess their criteria for biological individuality. Doing so reveals that they constructed a
multilevel explanation of evolution that anticipated modern interpretations in several important ways. Though it is certainly true that most of these early biologists failed to recognize natural
selection's pervasive agency, it is no less true that one of them, termite expert Alfred Emerson, artfully united the multilevel theory of ""emergent evolution"" with natural selection in a way that

as they often do. From this neo-Darwinian insight flow biological predictions that reconcile otherwise enigmatic structural and functional properties of sexual genomes, including many recently
uncovered features of nuclear DNA in Homo sapiens. Thus, we might suppose that molecular genetics and evolutionary genomics would be centerpieces of academic curricula in biology and medicine. The

and crystallized quantitatively in the early twentieth century. Hamiltonian inclusive fitness, with Price’s reformulation, provided the solution to Darwin’s ‘special difficulty’—the evolution of caste
polymorphism and sterility in social insects. Hamilton further explored the roles of inclusive fitness and reciprocation to tackle Darwin’s other difficulty, the evolution of human altruism. The

competition, permitting coexistence with other social insect species. In other words, kin selection—a form of intra-population dynamics—might enhance the species richness of the community, a higher-
level structure. The converse effect, from higher to lower levels, might also operate, whereby strong interspecific competition may limit the evolution of selfish individual traits. If the latter

0,angulo_social_2013,Do social groups prevent {Allee} effect related extinctions?: {The} case of wild dogs,2013-01-01,"BackgroundAllee effects may arise as the number of individuals decreases, thereby reducing opportunities for cooperation and constraining individual fitness, which can lead to population decrease and
extinction. Obligate cooperative breeders rely on a minimum group size to subsist and are thus expected to be particularly susceptible to Allee effects. Although Allee effects in some components of
the fitness of cooperative breeders have been detected, empirical confirmation of population extinction due to Allee effects is lacking yet. Because previous studies of cooperation have focused on
Allee effects affecting individual fitness (component Allee effect) and population dynamics (demographic Allee effect), we argue that a new conceptual level of Allee effect, the group Allee effect, is
needed to understand the special case of cooperative breeders.ResultsWe hypothesize that whilst individuals are vulnerable to Allee effects, the group could act as a buffer against population
extinction if: (i) individual fitness and group fate depend on group size but not on population size and (ii) group size is independent of population size (that is, at any population size, populations
comprise both large and small groups). We found that both conditions apply for the African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, and data on this species in Zimbabwe support our hypothesis.ConclusionsThe
importance of groups in obligate cooperative breeders needs to be accounted for within the Allee effect framework, through a group Allee effect, because the group mediates the relationship between
individual fitness and population performance. Whilst sociality is associated with a high probability of Allee effects, we suggest that cooperative individuals organized in relatively autonomous
groups within populations might be behaving in ways that diminish extinction risks caused by Allee effects. This study opens new avenues to a better understanding of the role of the evolution of
group-living on the probability of extinction faced by social species.","Angulo, Elena and Rasmussen, Greg S A and Macdonald, David W and Courchamp, Franck"
8,scott_reconciling_2013,Reconciling social interaction with habitat selection in territorial species,2013-01-01,"The concept of habitat selection as the primary force in clustered distributions has been challenged by behavioral studies of conspecific attraction. This has lead to two conflicting explanations for
settlement behavior, which we have integrated into one model. This model creates a range of fitness outcomes for different settlement strategies, encompassing the four combinations of positive and
negative effects of the habitat selection and social interaction. It expands the ideal free distribution models (negative intra-specific interactions and positive habitat selection), to consider
alternative situations where (1) beneficial social interaction increases fitness for clustered pairs in poor quality habitat, (2) neither habitat selection nor conspecific attraction can improve
fitness, and (3) where both are beneficial and do not interfere with each other. The model does this by establishing an intrinsic fitness, where the effects of both habitat selection (h) and
conspecific attractions (c) are neutral (h = c = 1) and do not influence settlement. Clustered distributions occur when h · c {\textgreater} 1 because the fitness in clusters is greater than intrinsic
fitness. Dispersed distributions occur when h · c {\textless} 1 and fitness is lower than the intrinsic. The benefit of the model is that it allows conspecific attraction to be considered a positive

moral reputation maybe something too important to be entrusted just to one's moral sense. A robust concern for one's reputation is likely to have evolved too. Here we explore some of the complex
relationships between morality and reputation both from an evolutionary and a cognitive point of view. People may behave morally because they intrinsically value doing so—a genuine moral reason—or in
order to gain the approval of others—an instrumental reason. Both moral and reputational concerns are commonly involved in moral behaviour and cannot be pried apart without understanding their
intricate relationships. Here we aim at contributing to such an understanding by investigating the role, content, and mechanisms of moral reputation. 1. Function and Motivation of Moral Behaviour","Sperber, Dan and Baumard, Nicolas"

Implicit in the work
described in this thesis is the idea that this  might best be achieved through devising neural circuits (tractable to evolutionary  exploration) that exhibit complementary functional characteristics.
We concentrate  on two problem domains; locomotion and sequence learning. For locomotion  we compare the use of GasNets and other adaptive networks. For sequence learning  we introduce a novel
connectionist model inspired by the role of dopamine  in the basal ganglia (commonly interpreted as a form of reinforcement learning).  This connectionist approach relies upon a new neuron model
inspired by notions  of energy efficient signalling. Two reward adaptive circuit variants were investigated.  These were applied respectively to two learning problems; where action  sequences are
required to take place in a strict order, and secondly, where action  sequences are robust to intermediate arbitrary states. We conclude the thesis  by proposing a formal model of functional
integration, encompassing locomotion  and sequence learning, extending ideas proposed by W. Ross Ashby.  A general model of the adaptive replicator is presented, incoporating subsystems  that are
tuned to continuous variation and discrete or conditional events.  Comparisons are made with Ross W. Ashby's model of ultrastability and his  ideas on adaptive behaviour. This model is intended to
support our assertion  that, GasNets (and similar networks) and reward adaptive circuits of the type  presented here, are intrinsically complementary. In conclusion we present some  ideas on how the
co-evolution of GasNet and reward adaptive circuits might lead  us to significant improvements in the synthesis of agents capable of exhibiting  complex adaptive behaviour.","McHale, G."

protocell can be achieved only if there is a selective pressure favoring protocells with a mixed template composition. Here we study analytically a group selection model for the coexistence between
two template types using the diffusion approximation of population genetics. The model combines competition at the template and protocell levels as well as genetic drift inside protocells. At the
steady state, we find a continuous phase transition separating the coexistence and segregation regimes, with the order parameter vanishing linearly with the distance to the critical point. In
addition, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the critical steady-state probability density of protocell compositions.","Fontanari, J. F. and Serva, M."
0,goldfinch_evolutionary_2012,Evolutionary psychology : theoretical and methodological foundations,2012-01-01,"Of all the research programmes in the evolutionary behavioural sciences, evolutionary  psychology is unique in the scale and intensity of criticism it faces, from both philosophers  and social
scientists, forming a powerful impression that, no matter its purported benefits,  evolutionary psychology is a discredited research programme, an outdated research  programme, something one can
legitimately dismiss.  This thesis contends that those who dismiss evolutionary psychology wholesale fail to  entitle themselves to that dismissal.  I begin by championing a streamlined evolutionary
psychology, one that navigates away  from unnecessary controversy, one that better reflects the actual practice of evolutionary  psychology on the ground, and one that doesn’t overshadow what’s
valuable about the  programme.  After correcting several common misconceptions about evolutionary psychology, I arrive at  the heart of what adaptationist hypothesizing can do for psychology:
discovering new  design features of extant psychological traits and discovering hitherto unknown  psychological traits. I go through the logic of adaptationist reasoning in psychology. Inter  alia, I
argue that, although evolutionary psychology hypotheses might start off as ‘simple’,  they can progressively become more complex, progressively mirroring the adaptations  they’re targeting. Existing
philosophy of science treatments of evolutionary psychology  have given prominence to sceptical arguments, which means the positive presentation of  evolutionary psychology has come rather short –
something I seek to redress by  demonstrating its potential for novel predictions across a wide spectrum of phenomena.  It’s reasonable to demand greater evidence for evolutionary psychology
explanations but  it’s wrong to demand that evolutionary psychology alone satisfy such demands – these  demands are properly allocated to the evolutionary and behavioural sciences collectively.  With
its legitimate and reasonable role in the evolutionary behavioural sciences correctly  identified, evolutionary psychology merits serious consideration – contrary to the  prevailing pessimism
concerning its credibility.","Goldfinch, A."

sexual maturation of young animals, which is known to be the main mechanism of density regulation. The increase in the local density of voles is accompanied by an increase in glucocorticoids in the
blood of mature and immature individuals of both sexes that indicates the important role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in density-dependent regulation. Another population of red-backed voles
from southwest Siberia that live in suboptimal habitats (Novosibirsk city vicinity) had a significantly lower density. Here, the dynamics of demographic traits and endocrine status of the individuals

131,spencer_home_2012,Home ranges and the value of spatial information,2012-01-01,"Abstract Animals concentrate their activities within areas we call home ranges because information about places increases fitness. Most animals, and certainly all mammals, store information about
places in cognitive maps—or neurally encoded representations of the geometric relations among places—and learn to associate objects or events with places on their map. I define the value of
information as a time-dependent increment it adds to any appropriate currency of fitness for an informed versus an uninformed forager, and integrate it into simple conceptual models that help explain
movements of animals that learn, forget, and use information. Unlike other space-use models, these recognize that movement decisions are based on an individual's imperfect and ever-changing
expectancies about the environment—rather than omniscience or ignorance. Using simple, deterministic models, I demonstrate how the use of such dynamic information explains why animals use home ranges,
and can help explain diverse movement patterns, including systematic patrolling or “traplining,” shifting activity or focal areas, extra-home-range exploration, and seemingly random (although goal-
directed and spatially contagious) movements. These models also provide insights about interindividual spacing patterns, from exclusive home ranges (whether defended as territories or not) to broadly
overlapping or shared ranges. Incorporating this dynamic view of animal expectancies and information value into more-complex and realistic movement models, such as random-walk, Bayesian foraging, and
multi-individual movement models, should facilitate a more comprehensive and empirical understanding of animal space-use phenomena. The fitness value of cognitive maps and the selective exploitation
of spatial information support a general theory of animal space use, which explains why mammals have home ranges and how they use them.","Spencer, Wayne D."

However,
a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in different ways in males and females, with female traits more often mediating competition for ecological resources, rather than
mate acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to
adopt an alternative conceptual framework—the theory of social selection—in which sexual selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting from all social interactions. In this
study, we summarize the history of the debate about female ornaments and weapons, and discuss potential resolutions. We review the components of fitness driving ornamentation in a wide range of
systems, and show that selection often falls outside the limits of traditional sexual selection theory, particularly in females. We conclude that the evolution of these traits in both sexes is best
understood within the unifying framework of social selection.","Tobias, Joseph A. and Montgomerie, Robert and Lyon, Bruce E."
189,lyon_sexual_2012,Sexual selection is a form of social selection,2012-01-01,"Social selection influences the evolution of weapons, ornaments and behaviour in both males and females. Thus, social interactions in both sexual and non-sexual contexts can have a powerful influence
on the evolution of traits that would otherwise appear to be detrimental to survival. Although clearly outlined by West-Eberhard in the early 1980s, the idea that social selection is a comprehensive
framework for the study of ornaments and weapons has largely been ignored. In West-Eberhard's view, sexual selection is a form of social selection—a concept supported by several lines of evidence.
Darwin's distinction between natural and sexual selection has been useful, but recent confusion about the limits of sexual selection suggests that some traits are not easily categorized as naturally
or sexually selected. Because social selection theory has much to offer the current debates about both sexual selection and reproductive competition in females, it is sometimes viewed, narrowly, to be
most useful when considering female roles. However, social selection theory encompasses much more than female reproductive competition. Our goal here was to provide that broader perspective.","Lyon, Bruce E. and Montgomerie, Robert"
0,mitteldorf_adaptive_2012,Adaptive aging in the context of evolutionary theory,2012-01-01,"Compelling evidence for an adaptive origin of aging has clashed with traditional evolutionary theory based on exclusively individual selection. The consensus view has been to try to understand aging
in the context of a narrow, restrictive evolutionary paradigm, called the Modern Synthesis, or neo-Darwinism. But neo-Darwinism has shown itself to be inadequate in other ways, failing to account for
stable ecosystems, for the evolution of sex and the maintenance of diversity and the architecture of the genome, which appears to be optimized for evolvability. Thus aging is not the only reason to
consider overhauling the standard theoretical framework. Selection for stable ecosystems is rapid and efficient, and so it is the easiest modification of the neo-Darwinian paradigm to understand and
to model. Aging may be understood in this context. More profound and more mysterious are the ways in which the process of evolution itself has been transformed in a boot-strapping process of selection
for evolvability. Evolving organisms have learned to channel their variation in ways that are likely to enhance their long-term prospects. This is an expanded notion of fitness. Only in this context
can the full spectrum of sophisticated adaptations be understood, including aging, sex, diversity, ecological interdependence, and the structure of the genome.","Mitteldorf, J. J."

For much of the XX century, it was almost universally believed that evolution theory prohibited
programmed (adaptive) aging in mammals and there was little direct experimental or observational evidence favoring it. More recently, multiple new evolutionary mechanics concepts that support
programmed aging and steadily increasing direct evidence favoring it overwhelmingly support the existence of programmed aging in humans and other organisms. This issue is important because the
different theories suggest very different mechanisms for the aging process that in turn suggest very different paths toward treating and preventing age-related diseases.","Goldsmith, T. C."

0,snowden_behavioural_2012,Behavioural effects of caffeine : the specificity hypothesis,2012-01-01,"This thesis argues that caffeine use offered a survival advantage to our ancestors and that moderate use continues to offer modern humans benefits. Caffeine ingestion, through the blocking of
adenosine receptors, elicits broad elements of the mammalian threat response, specifically from the ‘flight or fight’ and ‘tend and befriend’ repertoires of behaviour: in effect, caffeine hijacks
elements of the stress response. If the effects of caffeine had been discovered recently, rather than being available to Homo sapiens since Neolithic hunter gatherer times, it is likely that caffeine
would be considered a ‘smart’ drug. More caffeine is being ingested today than ever previously recorded. Caffeine use is found across all age groups, all socio-economic strata, most ethnic groups, and
is being used increasingly by the medical and pharmaceutical industries and by the armed forces. Yet despite this wide usage and a substantial body of research literature, there is at present no clear
pattern or plausible model for the way caffeine achieves its effects. There is much contradiction in the literature and ambiguity as to why caffeine use should improve performance on some tasks,
impair it on others and have no effect on other tasks, for some but not all of the time. The present work argues, through an examination of the specificity of caffeine’s operation, that these effects
are not arbitrary but elicited by the nature of the tasks, in particular that caffeine ingestion affects those processes and behaviours which improve the probability of survival under perceived threat
or stress. This is argued through the perspective of evolutionary psychology and relies theoretically on Polyvagal Theory. The argument generates testable hypotheses and empirical support for the
thesis is garnered from nine experiments on card-sorting, verbal and numerical processing, local and global categorization, field dependence-independence, the Stroop task, tests of visuo-spatial
ability, and from a correlational study of caffeine use and personality traits. It is concluded that moderate caffeine use in healthy adults promotes behaviours likely to be adaptive under perceived
threat or stress. Limitations of both theory and empirical work and are discussed, together with potential practical applications and suggestions for further work.","Snowden, W."
97,hawkins_delayed_2012,Delayed plumage maturation and delayed reproductive investment in birds,2012-01-01,"Delayed plumage maturation is the delayed acquisition of a definitive colour and pattern of plumage until after the first potential breeding period in birds. Here we provide a comprehensive overview
of the numerous studies of delayed plumage maturation and a revised theoretical framework for understanding the function of delayed plumage maturation in all birds. We first distinguish between
hypotheses that delayed plumage maturation is attributable to a moult constraint with no adaptive function and hypotheses that propose that delayed plumage maturation is a component of an adaptive
life‐history strategy associated with delayed reproductive investment. We then recognize three potential benefits of delayed plumage maturation: crypsis, mimicry and status signaling. Evidence
suggests that delayed plumage maturation is not a consequence of developmental constraints and instead represents a strategy to maximize reproductive success in circumstances where young adults cannot
effectively compete with older adults for limited resources, particularly breeding opportunities. A multi‐factorial explanation that takes into account lifespan and the degree of competition for
limited breeding resources and that combines the benefits of an inconspicuous appearance with the benefits of honest signaling of reduced competitiveness provides a general explanation for the
function of delayed plumage maturation in most bird species. Delayed plumage maturation should be viewed as a component of alternative reproductive strategies that can include delay in both plumage
and sexual development. Such strategies are frequently facultative, with individuals breeding prior to the acquisition of definitive plumages when conditions are favourable. Presumably, the benefits
of delayed plumage maturation ultimately enhance lifetime reproductive success, and studying delayed plumage maturation within the context of lifetime reproductive success should be a goal of future
studies.","Hawkins, Gerard L. and Hill, Geoffrey E. and Mercadante, Austin"

theory has in fact taken. This holds with regard to both gene-Darwinism, a purified Darwinian approach biologizing the social sciences, and processDarwinism found in the disciplines of psychology,
philosophy of science, and economics. Although Darwinism is often linked to highly confirmed biological theories, some of its interpretations seem to profit from tautological claims as well, where
scientific reputation cloaks ideological usage. This book discusses central tenets of Darwinism historically as well as systematically, for example the history of different Darwinian paradigms, the
units-of-selection debate, and the philosophical problem of induction as basis of metaphysical Darwinism. Crucially the book addresses the Darwinian claim that evolution is governed by an immutable
and unrelentingly cruel law of natural selection. Paradoxically, Darwin’s theory is a static, non-evolutionary theory of evolution. The current book sketches the historical background and provides
suggestions that may help to replace this approach by the idea of an evolution of evolutionary mechanisms (see Escher’s “Drawing Hands” on the cover). This view even suggests a tendency to overcome
the blindness of the knowledge acquisition of primordial Darwinian processes and allows for some freedom from external environments. This book first develops a radically Darwinian approach, then
criticises this approach from within. Even Darwinism has a tendency to transcend itself. Although the book addresses several empirical issues, it does not challenge particular findings. Instead it
builds on many insights of Darwinism and provides a proposal for interpreting known empirical evidence in a different light. It should help pave the way for further developing an understanding of
nature that transcends Darwinian metaphysics. Momme von Sydow","Sydow, Momme von"

and Gulleries Nature Reserve, commonly referred to as Ravenglass Gullery, in northwest England (54° 21' N., 3° 25' W., Fig. 1). It consisted of a 30 ha. strip of coastal dunes (only 10 ha. used in
1958) in a peninsula which projects off the Cumberland coast into the Irish Sea. The study area is isolated to some extent from neighbouring areas by high bare dunes and an estuary. It overlapped to
only a very small extent the Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus colony (Marchant 1952). The vegetation consists mainly of marram grass (Ammophila sp.) and is scarce. The Skylarks occupied mainly the

days of publication, opponents organized symposia; wrote critical editorials; picketed in Harvard Square; and, at one meeting, assaulted Wilson with a bucket of cold water before he could deliver his
address. Fueling this reaction was Wilson's temerity in asserting that the principles of the new synthetic theory applied no less to humans than to other species—and then to use the penultimate
chapter to apply his theory to explaining human mating, aggression, and the development of moral and religious systems. Even some who were sympathetic with sociobiology were taken aback by some of the
imperialistic sounding statements made by Wilson and his disciples, like Robert Trivers, who prophesized: “Sooner or later, political science, law, economics, psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology
will all be branches of sociobiology.”","Losco, Joseph"

level. Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially when the behaviors in question are flexible.
To address this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured populations. We find that group-
optimal behaviors can evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral responses to each other’s actions. The evolution of such behavioral responses, in turn, is
predicated on the nature of the proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve to sustain maximum
group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in determining
the course of social evolution. We also highlight the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
transitions in individuality.","Akçay, Erol and Cleve, Jeremy Van"

emergence of the market order as the unintended consequence of an evolutionary process in which groups whose rules of behavior led to a comparative increase in population and wealth were favored over
others. Key to Hayek’s theory was the claim that the rules of the market, on which modern civilization relies, evolved at the meta-individual level and therefore surpass human reason. Hayek believed
that his theory provided scientific explanation for the superiority of the market order over rational planning. In this article, I conduct a selective comparison between Hayek’s and Darwin’s theories
of cultural group selection and analyze the role that demographic growth and reason play in their respective accounts. I first present Hayek’s theory of cultural group selection, its sources of
inspiration, and its important place in his intellectual legacy. I then compare Hayek’s claims to Darwin’s views and highlight fundamental differences in their evaluation of the role of reason in

1,lekevicius_review_2011,A review of and some comments on the attempts to construct an overarching theory of ecosystems plasticity,2011-01-01,"It is generally accepted that life uses two distinct mechanisms during adaptation to the environment: evolutionary and individual. The latter is known as phenotypic plasticity. However, several
decades ago, a conviction emerged and later strengthened that populations and ecological communities also tend to stabilize the essential variables (total biomass, productivity, adaptability, etc.) to
a certain degree, regardless of uncertainty of environmental conditions. A response to this uncertainty is a change in the frequency of preadapted genotypes and compensatory fluctuations in population
sizes. Adaptation can be regarded as a never-ending multilevel hierarchical process of individual-, population- and community-level adjustments to a changing environment. According to these concepts,
adaptation is like a process during which individuals, populations and entire communities can adjust their optima to the ever-changing environmental conditions. Individual and populational
rearrangements are means for a more subtle adjustment of the community optimum and the lines of defence, one following the other, on the road of stressful impacts towards the essential variables of an
ecosystem. The authors of this conception, e. g. M. Conrad, V. N. Novoseltsev, H.-R. Gregorius, E. Lekevicius, also believe that these mechanisms should interact in a quite determined manner; this
brings us hope that a unified theory on the plasticity of ecosystems will be developed. In this review an attempt is made to describe these concepts which are still in development and to reveal their
strong, well-founded aspects as well as weak points. It is concluded that the multifarious attempts to falsify the conception are needed.","Lekevičius, Edmundas"

0,melbinger_role_2011,On the role of fluctuations in evolutionary dynamics and transport on microtubules,2011-01-01,"Life shows an astonishing diversity and complexity. Its underlying biological processes are adapted to fulfill various specific tasks with remarkable accuracy. The enormous precision, with which life
operates, is even more impressive considering the ubiquitious fluctuations in nature. Fluctuations in diverse biological quantities arise due to intrinsic randomness of biological processes caused by
the discrete nature of the involved substances and thermal influences. In this thesis, the impact of such fluctuations is discussed for two specific examples. The first part is concerned with
evolutionary dynamics, while the second part focusses on transport on intracellular filaments. The driving force of evolution is selection. It favors fitter individuals and thereby changes the
composition of a population. The origins of such evolutionary dynamics are varying birth and death events of single individuals. Hence, evolutionary dynamics of a population is closely related to
population dynamics describing the time evolution of the population size. The interplay of these two types of dynamics is an important aspect of this thesis. As such, we propose a full stochastic
model considering the evolution of both a population’s composition and its size. To validate our approach, an important example is analyzed, namely the dilemma of cooperation in bacterial populations.
Cooperating bacteria produce a certain protein which is beneficial for the population as a whole. As the production of this public good is metabolically costly, cooperators have an evolutionary
disadvantage compared to non-contributing free-riders. This example illustrates the crucial role of demographic fluctuations, the importance of which increases with decreasing population size. In
particular, during population bottlenecks these fluctuations may be strong enough to overcome the selection disadvantage of cooperators. For this reason, we find that the level of cooperation
increases transiently. To explain cooperative behavior also in the long run, we further study the repetitive fragmentation of a population into small subcolonies. In such a model, two distinct
mechanisms favor cooperative behavior. The group-growth mechanism facilitates the evolution of cooperation from a single mutant to coexistence between cooperators and free-riders. In contrast, the
group-fixation mechanism can lead to a purely cooperative population under the condition that a certain threshold level of cooperation is already present. The second part of this thesis is concerned
with molecular motor proteins walking along microtubule filaments which are constituents of the cytoskeleton. These motors transport large macromolecules through the crowded cytosol. Furthermore, they
can act as polymerases or depolymerases at the microtubule tip and thereby regulate its length. This length-regulation is especially important for cell division as a dynamic length adaption of the
filaments is essential there. We investigate the interaction between depolymerizing motors and microtubules in a stochastic model accounting for crowding phenomena. Importantly, our model can be
validated by comparison with recent experiments without employing any fit parameters. Our model provides insight into the role of molecular jams along the track. These jams result in two regimes of
qualitatively different behavior. In the first regime, the depolymerization speed depends solely on the microscopic depolymerization rate, while in the second regime the density of molecular motors on
the filament regulates the speed. As the motor density depends on the length of the microtubules, the depolymerization speed also varies with length. In combination with polymerization a certain
length can be adjusted. We investigate the regimes where such a well-defined length can be achieved by analyzing two distinct polymerization scenarios. In the exclusive scenario, the microtubule only
polymerizes if the tip is unoccupied by a depolymerizing motor. In the non-exclusive scenario, by contrast, polymerization always happens at a certain rate. Our analysis reveals differences between
these scenarios which may help to clarify the actual depolymerization behavior in future experiments. The outline of this thesis is as follows. In Chapter 1, a short introduction focussing on the role
of fluctuations is provided. Part I is concerned with evolutionary dynamics. In Chapter 2 the basic mathematical concepts are introduced while in Chapter 3 the dilemma of cooperation for individuals
divided into subcolonies is investigated. Part II focusses on transport along microtubules. Chapter 4 mainly deals with the transport properties of molecular motors. Finally, in Chapter 5 length-
regulation due to polymerization and depolymerization is discussed.","Melbinger, A."

0,cremer_evolutionary_2011,Evolutionary principles promoting cooperation,2011-01-01,"Life shows a stunning level of complexity. Understanding the emergence of this complexity and the functioning of intricate biological processes lies at the heart of modern biology. One major hallmark
of biological complexity, including many forms of interacting organisms, is cooperation. Cooperating individuals are, by providing a benefit, capable to facilitate a better depletion of resources, a
more efficient protection against threats, or the formation of social entities, to name but a few advantages. However, explaining cooperation is a major challenge of evolutionary theory: Why do
cooperators persist if non-cooperative individuals can get away from paying the costs and benefit from faithful cooperators? This dilemma of cooperation emerges for a vast variety of life forms and on
different levels of biological complexity. This thesis focuses on the ecological factors promoting the evolution of cooperation. In particular, the role of demographic fluctuations, growth-dynamics
and population structure is considered. Correspondingly, this thesis is divided into three main parts, briefly introduced in the following. In the first part, the role of demographic fluctuations is
studied. By the stochastic nature of the underlying birth and death events, the evolutionary dynamics of a population is always subject to demographic fluctuations. We here analyze their impact on the
evolutionary outcome and compare it with the selection for fitter individuals. We focus on ‘evolutionary games’ and show that there are broad regimes of neutral-evolution where fluctuations dominate
the dynamics. Furthermore, we quantify the edge of neutral evolution where fitness-differences become important and demographic fluctuations are only of minor relevance. The second part considers the
coupling of evolutionary and population dynamics. Growth and decline of a population as well as its internal evolution result from the same birth and death events and thus are coupled. We introduce a
stochastic model to study this coupling and discuss the relation to common evolutionary models which assume a constant population size and hence do not take this coupling into account. As a particular
example, we analyze the dilemma of cooperation in a growing population. We show that the interplay of demographic fluctuations and population dynamics can drastically influence the evolutionary
outcome and lead to a transient increase of cooperation. We study this increase for different typical types of microbial growth dynamics. In the third part, the evolutionary dynamics in structured
populations is investigated. In particular, we consider group-structured populations where individuals are regularly assorted into new groups. The model serves as a null model to study cooperation in
microbes under the permanent influence of population-bottlenecks. These can arise in nature due to life-cycles or migration events. We analyze the interplay of growth, internal evolution, and
assortment dynamics and show that there are two mechanisms promoting cooperation: the group-growth and the group-fixation mechanism. The group-growth mechanism is based on the faster growth of more
cooperative groups and facilitates the evolution of cooperation from one single cooperating mutant on. The group-fixation mechanism rest upon the advantage of purely cooperative groups and can lead to
entirely cooperative populations in the long run. Experiments to test our predictions and their dependence on the key parameters are currently performed by Prof. Kirsten Jung and Prof. Heinrich Jung
at her chair of microbiology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich. The outline of this thesis is as follows. Chapter 1 gives a short introduction to evolutionary theory in general and states
the broader context of this thesis. The following Chapters 2 and 3 provide an introduction to the mathematical formulations of evolutionary dynamics and the issue of cooperation, respectively.
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 then consider the three main issues introduced before. Each of these chapters ends with a short discussion and a reprint of the corresponding papers and manuscripts. In Chapter 4,
demographic fluctuations and the edge of neutral evolution are analyzed. Subsequently, the coupling between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics is discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, the role
of population structure is discussed in Chapter 6. It also considers microbial organisms and their life-cycles in detail.","Cremer, J."

How selection acts across this
hierarchy is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Recent studies have suggested that genome size is influenced largely by the balance of selection, mutation and drift in lineages with
different population sizes. Here we use population cage and maternal transmission experiments to identify the relative strength of selection at an individual and cytoplasmic level. No significant
trends were observed in the frequency of large (L) and small (S) mtDNAs across 14 generations in population cages. In all replicate cages, new length variants were observed in heteroplasmic states
indicating that spontaneous length mutations occurred in these experimental populations. Heteroplasmic flies carrying L genomes were more frequent than those carrying S genomes suggesting an
asymmetric mutation dynamic from larger to smaller mtDNAs. Mother-offspring transmission of heteroplasmy showed that the L mtDNA increased in frequency within flies both between and within generations
despite sampling drift of the same intensity as occurred in population cages. These results suggest that selection for mtDNA size is stronger at the cytoplasmic than at the organismal level. The
fixation of novel mtDNAs within and between species requires a transient intracellular heteroplasmic stage. The balance of population genetic forces at the cytoplasmic and individual levels governs
the units of selection on mtDNA, and has implications for evolutionary inference as well as for the effects of mtDNA mutations on fitness, disease and aging.","Rand, David M."

These
are the levels of selection debate, the metaphor of the tragedy of the commons, and the evolutionary study of sexual conflict. We analyze the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a curious system where an
asexual all-female fish species (the Amazon molly Poecilia formosa) requires sperm from other species as a developmental trigger, without utilizing the genes from sperm. The dynamics of such a system
bear strong resemblance to host–parasite dynamics, and populations of the sexual ‘host’ species persist much better if males avoid mating with Amazons. However, such avoidance may compromise their
current mating success, and if this is the case, prudent mating becomes an altruistic trait that helps to keep an accumulating problem of a competing species at bay, and Amazon-free space can be seen
to form a common good that a population should maintain for future generations. A model shows that the evolution of altruistic mating restraint is possible but selection for short-term gains means
that it will remain less than perfect. This helps to explain why the anomalous gynogenetic system can persist, but it also raises questions about what kinds of traits can be classified as adaptations
when optimization is not perfect and traits evolve to achieve short-term goals better than long-term performance. Contributing to the levels of selection debate, we encourage researchers to study the
implications of the different timescales involved in the eco-evolutionary process.","Kokko, Hanna and Heubel, Katja U."

During this
time, birds and mammals have taken centre stage as model vertebrate systems for exploring why helpers help. However, fish have great potential for enhancing our understanding of the generality and
adaptiveness of helping behaviour because of the ease with which they can be experimentally manipulated under controlled laboratory and field conditions. In particular, the freshwater African cichlid,
Neolamprologus pulcher, has emerged as a promising model species for investigating the evolution of cooperative breeding, with 64 papers published on this species over the past 27 years. Here we
clarify current knowledge pertaining to the costs and benefits of helping in N. pulcher by critically assessing the existing empirical evidence. We then provide a comprehensive examination of the
evidence pertaining to four key hypotheses for why helpers might help: (1) kin selection; (2) pay‐to‐stay; (3) signals of prestige; and (4) group augmentation. For each hypothesis, we outline the
underlying theory, address the appropriateness of N. pulcher as a model species and describe the key predictions and associated empirical tests. For N. pulcher, we demonstrate that the kin selection
and group augmentation hypotheses have received partial support. One of the key predictions of the pay‐to‐stay hypothesis has failed to receive any support despite numerous laboratory and field
studies; thus as it stands, the evidence for this hypothesis is weak. There have been no empirical investigations addressing the key predictions of the signals of prestige hypothesis. By outlining the
key predictions of the various hypotheses, and highlighting how many of these remain to be tested explicitly, our review can be regarded as a roadmap in which potential paths for future empirical
research into the evolution of cooperative breeding are proposed. Overall, we clarify what is currently known about cooperative breeding in N. pulcher, address discrepancies among studies, caution
against incorrect inferences that have been drawn over the years and suggest promising avenues for future research in fishes and other taxonomic groups.","Wong, Marian and Balshine, Sigal"

clarify links between different studies. We show that confusion has arisen owing to researchers misidentifying model parameters with the b and c terms in Hamilton’s rule, and misidentifying measures
of genotypic similarity or genealogical relationship with the coefficient of genetic relatedness, r. More generally, we emphasize the need to distinguish between general kin‐selection theory that

This makes it impossible to associate an invariant
phenotype with a genotype: the social context is crucial. Descriptions of metazoan development, which often is viewed as the acme of cooperative social behaviour, ignore or downplay this fact. The
implicit justification for doing so is based on a group-selectionist point of view. Namely, embryos are clones, therefore all cells have the same evolutionary interest, and the visible differences
between cells result from a common strategy. The reasoning is flawed, because phenotypic heterogeneity within groups can result from contingent choices made by cells from a flexible repertoire as in
multicellular development. What makes that possible is phenotypic plasticity, namely the ability of a genotype to exhibit different phenotypes. However, co-operative social behaviour with division of
labour requires that different phenotypes interact appropriately, not that they belong to the same genotype, or have overlapping genetic interests. We sketch a possible route to the evolution of
social groups that involves many steps: (a) individuals that happen to be in spatial proximity benefit simply by virtue of their number; (b) traits that are already present act as preadaptations and
improve the efficiency of the group; and (c) new adaptations evolve under selection in the social context--that is, via interactions between individuals--and further strengthen group behaviour. The
Dictyostelid or cellular slime mould amoebae (CSMs) become multicellular in an unusual way, by the aggregation of free-living cells. In nature the resulting group can be genetically homogeneous
(clonal) or heterogeneous (polyclonal); in either case its development, which displays strong cooperation between cells (to the extent of so-called altruism) is not affected. This makes the CSMs
exemplars for the study of social behaviour.","Nanjundiah, Vidyanand and Sathe, Santosh"

scientists to construct models, design experiments, interpret evidence, etc. But as powerful as they are, heuristics are also error-prone. Therefore, I argue that they key to prudently using a
heuristic is the articulation of meta-heuristics—guidelines to the kinds of problems for which a heuristic is wellor ill-suited. Given that heuristics will introduce certain errors into our scientific
investigations, I emphasize the importance of a particular category of meta-heuristics involving the search for robust evidence. Robustness is understood to be the epistemic virtue bestowed by
agreement amongst multiple modes of determination. The more modes we have at our disposal, and the more these confirm the same result, the more confident can we be that a result is not a mere artifact
of some heuristic simplification. Through an analysis of case-studies in the philosophy of biology and clinical trials, I develop a principled method for modeling and evaluating heuristics and
robustness claims in a qualitative problem space. The second half of the dissertation deploys the heuristic methodology to address ethical and epistemological issues in the science of clinical trials.
To that end, I develop a network model for the problem space of clinical research, capable of representing the various kinds of experiments, epistemic relationships, and ethical justifications
intrinsic to the domain. I then apply this model to ongoing research with the antibacterial agent, moxifloxacin, for the treatment of tuberculosis, tracking its development from initially successful
and promising in vitro and animal studies to its disappointing and discordant performance across five human efficacy trials. Given this failure to find a robust result with moxifloxacin across animal
and human studies, what should researchers now do? While my final analysis of this case does not definitively answer that question, I demonstrate how my methodology, unlike a statistical meta-
analysis, helps to clarify the directions for further research.","Hey, S."

It is not clear, though, if clonal aggregations should have spatial structure, as protecting clone-mates is the genetic
equivalent of protecting self. ‘Fitness discounting’ theory states that immediate reproductive opportunities are of greater value than are delayed opportunities. Thus, we hypothesized that spatial
structure should exist in colonies of unequal-aged, clonal organisms like aphids. We predicted that, compared to reproductive (5th instar) individuals, young (2nd and 3rd instar) juveniles (i.e., the
youngest instars capable of emitting an alarm signal) should occupy the most dangerous feeding positions. As individuals approach reproductive maturity and alarm signals decline (4th instar), they
should occupy increasingly safer feeding positions. We tested these predictions by documenting the spatial distribution of two (green and pink) pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, asexual lineages
(“clones”) at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after host plant colonization. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that early (2nd and 3rd) instar aphids occupied feeding positions with the highest
predation risk. Upon reaching the penultimate (4th) instar, individuals dispersed from the colony to colonize other leaves. Thus, pea aphid colonies are not random aggregations; aphid colony structure

we discuss the nature of the acoustic signal. Second, we look at the process of song learning. Third, we describe a specific song mechanism, social shaping. Fourth, we look at the more general
developmental process of neophenogenesis. Fifth, we consider the developmental ecology for social learning. Finally, we describe how social networks measures can be used to capture the nature of
social interactions as the engines of song learning. Taken as a whole, we argue that culturally transmitted behaviors structure social interactions that predict the acquisition of species’ typical
behaviors necessary for successful reproduction.","West, M. and King, A. and Kohn, G."

interpretation of the drivers of the evolution of social behaviour. Here, I will illustrate in a model based on the haystack model, which is often used in the context of group selection, that it
allows a kin selection as well as a group selection interpretation. To do so I will analyse a variant of the haystack model in which the local dynamics are specified through a continuous time model.
From the description of the dynamics the cost and the benefits of the interaction can be calculated, as well as the relatedness. We also revisit the interpretation of Maynard-Smith, who originally
described the model, and show that this interpretation can be found if one assumes strong selection. This shows how the various interpretations of the evolution of social behaviour all can follow from
the same model. It also shows how ecological details of the interaction are crucially important in interpreting and understanding the process of evolution.","Jansen, Vincent A. A."

Complex instincts such as building of combs of hexagonal cells were one
problem and were explained by showing plausible intermediate stages. A more serious challenge was posed by the multiple worker castes seen in many ants. How could sterile individuals continue to
evolve? A careful reading of the Origin suggests that Darwin was not primarily concerned by the evolution of worker sterility itself, which he considered a minor difficulty. Some modern commentaries
on Darwin and insect workers seem to be cases of present interests interfering with the interpretation of the past. From a modern perspective, the evolution of a worker caste, and its corollary
altruism, are evolutionary puzzles inasmuch as natural selection normally favors greater, not lesser, individual reproduction. These puzzles were resolved by Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness. We
now have a good functional understanding of how natural selection can cause both the origin of workers and their elaboration into greater levels of sterility and multiple morphological castes.
Mechanistic understanding of morphological castes is also increasing via research into alternative developmental pathways. When the Origin was written, genetics did not exist and it would have been
virtually impossible for Darwin to elaborate such ideas. However, the Origin probably addressed the main questions in the minds of Victorian readers in relation to insect workers. Darwin was prescient
in having insights with close relationships to modern-day interests and the key principles involved, including kinship and benefits to the colony, even if these are not exact precursors to modern
thinking.","Ratnieks, Francis L. W. and Foster, Kevin R. and Wenseleers, Tom"

Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1841–1848. Experience has established that the recovery of many collapsed stocks takes much longer than predicted by traditional fishery population models. We put
forward the hypothesis that stock collapse is associated with disruption of the biological mechanisms that sustain life-cycle closure of intrapopulation contingents. Based on a review of case studies
of nine marine fish stocks, we argue that stock collapses not only involve biomass loss, but also the loss of structural elements related to life-cycle diversity (contingents), as well as the
breakdown of socially transmitted traditions (through a curtailed age range). Behavioural mechanisms associated with these structural elements could facilitate recovery of depleted populations.
Migratory behaviour is argued to relate to phenotypic plasticity and the persistence of migration routes to social interactions. The case studies represent collapsed or depleted populations that
recovered after a relatively short period (striped bass, capelin), after more than a decade (herring and sardine), or not at all (anchovy, cod). Contrasting the population dynamics from these stocks
leads us to make a distinction between a depleted and a collapsed population, where, in addition to biomass depletion, the latter includes damage to contingent structure or space-use pattern. We also
propose a mechanism to explain how lost habitats are recolonized.","Petitgas, Pierre and Secor, Dave H. and McQuinn, Ian and Huse, Geir and Lo, Nancy"

Most biologists acknowledge multiple levels of selection - from the gene, the
trait, and the organism, to the family, the group, and the species. However, it is the debate about group selection that Mark E. Borrello focuses on in ""Evolutionary Restraints"". Tracing the history
of biological attempts to determine whether selection could lead to the evolution of fitter groups, Borrello takes as his focus the British naturalist V. C. Wynne-Edwards, who proposed that animals
could regulate their own population levels and thereby avoid overexploitation of their food and other resources. By the mid-twentieth century, Wynne-Edwards became the primary advocate for group
selection theory and precipitated a debate that engaged the most significant evolutionary biologists, including Ernst Mayr, John Maynard Smith, G. C. Williams, and Richard Dawkins. The resultant
interpretations and arguments bled out into broader conversations about population regulation, environmental crises, and the evolution of human and animal social behavior. ""Evolutionary Restraints""

migration: migrants had even higher fat reserves than residents, while no significant difference in the body mass was recorded. The increase in fat reserves in the long-tailed tit during migration
period was similar to the seasonal changes in energy reserves known for typical migrants. This makes it possible for late-migrating individuals to maintain higher total speed of migration compared to

damage from fundamental deteriorative processes? This question has now persisted for 150 years. Historically, observational evidence generally favors active aging. However, the nature of the evolution
process has been thought to preclude evolution and retention of organism design features that purposely cause deterioration or otherwise actively limit life span. More recently, discoveries such as
aging genes have increased the weight of empirical evidence for programmed aging and our increasing knowledge regarding the nature of the mammal inheritance process has added to questions regarding
the validity of traditional evolutionary mechanics concepts. Alternatives to traditional mechanics concepts have subsequently appeared, most of which support active aging, and theories of biological
aging based on the alternative evolutionary mechanics theories have been produced.This article compares active and passive aging concepts in light of various observations, provides an overview of the
historical interaction between aging theory and evolution theory, and outlines major issues that currently exist regarding the mechanics of evolution. A specific candidate structure for an active
mammal aging mechanism is presented and a specific evolutionary rationale, an evolvability theory of aging, which allows for the evolution of that mechanism, is suggested.This issue has substantial
public health implications because understanding of massively age-dependent conditions such as cancer demands understanding of the aging process. Also, active theories suggest significant additional

Here, we present a quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have previously been modeled independently. We show
that social selection affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This covariance can be created by both relatedness
and IGEs, which are shown to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness and derive a version of
Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and weapons as
examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured

Vicar of Bray, the Ratchet or the Hitch-hiker theory. Bell (The masterpiece of nature. The evolution and genetics of sexuality. University of California Press, Berkeley, LA, 1982) formulated the Red
Queen Hypothesis (RQH) which explains the persistence of sexual reproduction as an outcome of a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites. By sexual recombination and genetic
diversification hosts minimize the risk of pathogen infection. Since virulence of pathogens is genetically determined and often species specific, parasites are mostly adapted to common host genotypes,
whereas rare and divergent genotypes are less infected and therefore have a selective advantage. Employing Dawkins (The extended phenotype. The long reach of the gene, 1999) central theorem of the
extended phenotype to the RQH, mating systems in hosts might be a result of the long reach of the parasites genes. Here now the hypothesis is proposed, that evolution by hybridisation and polyploidy
in host plants is an extended phenotype of parasites, a response of hosts triggered by the parasites genes to slow down the effects of the Red Queen strategy of plants. Thus, hybridisation and
polyploidy might have evolved by parasite pressure and not by host strategy. This hypothesis is called the “hybridisation-of-the-host-hypothesis”.ZusammenfassungSeit 1700, nach der wissenschaftlichen
Anerkennung von Sexualität bei Pflanzen steht die Frage nach Bedeutung und Erhalt sexueller Reproduktion bis heute im Mittelpunkt vieler wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen, deren Ergebnisse zu eine
Reihe von Theorien und Hypothesen über Sexualität geführt haben. 1982 formulierte G. Bell die Red Queen Hypothese (RQH), die die Existenz von sexueller Reproduktion als das Resultat einer
Koevolutionsbeziehung zwischen Wirten und ihren Parasiten erklärt. Durch Sexualität und genetische Diversifizierung minimieren Wirte das Risiko einer Infektion mit Pathogenen. Da Virulenz von
Parasiten zumeist genetisch determiniert und häufig wirtsspezifisch ist, sind Pathogene in den meisten Fällen an weitverbreitete und häufige Genotypen von Wirten angepasst, während seltene Genotypen
weniger infiziert werden und einen Selektionsvorteil haben. Durch die Anwendung der zentralen Idee des Werkes von R. Dawkins eines extended phenotypes von Parasiten auf die RQH von Wirten ist es
einleuchtend, dass Anteile am Reproduktionssystem bei Wirten das Resultat einer Wirkung (eines extended phenotypes) von Parasiten sind. In diesem Artikel wird die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass die
Evolution von Polyploidie und Hybridisierung bei Wirtspflanzen ein extended phenotype von Parasiten sein könnte. d.h. eine Antwort von Wirten auf eine durch Parasiten bewirkte Gegenstrategie zur
Verlangsamung der Diversifizierungseffekte der Red Queen Strategie. Unter dieser neuen Hypothese, die erstmalig ein Erklärungsmodell für die weitverbreitete Existenz von Polyploidie und Hybridisierung

Emerson and Ernst Mayr after the second world war. By the 1950s and early 1960s, these authors had developed an influential concept of species as coadapted genetic complexes at equilibrium. At this
time many features of species were seen as group advantages maintained by selection to avoid breakdown of beneficial coadaptation and the ‘gene pool’. Speciation thus seemed difficult. It seemed to
require, more so than today, an external deus ex machina , such as allopatry or the founder effect, rather than ordinary within-species processes of natural selection, sexual selection, drift and gene
flow.  In the mid-1960s, the distinctions between group and individual selection were clarified. Dobzhansky and Mayr both understood the implications, but their views on species changed little. These
group selectionist ideas now seem peculiar, and are becoming distinctly less popular today. Few vestiges of group selectionism and species-level adaptationism remain in recent reviews of speciation.

If those ideas survive testing, then they are considered ‘the truth’, or more crucially, truth-for-now, for the essence
of science is that if a new idea provides a better explanation of the way the world is, the truth changes. Darwin’s idea of evolution by natural selection, published as the Origin in 1859, replaced
the earlier truth of physico- or natural-theology introduced by John Ray in 1691. Despite resistance by the church, Darwin’s truth gained widespread acceptance, in part due to the efforts of T. H.
Huxley, who on reading the Origin said ‘How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!’ Despite natural selection’s enormous explanatory power, there were certain phenomena it apparently could not
explain, including female promiscuity. It was only in the 1960s when natural selection was viewed as operating explicitly on individuals (rather than populations or groups), that this changed. Rather
than being a cooperative venture between the sexes, sexual reproduction was now viewed in terms of conflicts of interests, and in so doing provided an explanation for female promiscuity (albeit in a
male-biased sort of way). Until this point, sexual selection had been concerned exclusively with mate acquisition. With an evolutionary perspective focussing on individuals, it was recognized that
sexual selection might continue after insemination, and that rather than competing for partners, males compete for fertilizations. Later it was acknowledged that females, through cryptic processes can
also influence the outcome of sperm competition. Today, post-copulatory sexual selection provides explanations for many previously bewildering reproductive traits, including the extraordinary
diversity in male and female genitalia, the design of spermatozoa and ova, of seminal fluid and of copulation behaviour itself","Birkhead, T. R."

The Weismann's idea that sex and recombination provide the variation for the natural selection to
act upon is dominated in most discussions of the biological meaning of the sexual reproduction. Here, the idea is substantiated that the main advantage of sex is the opposite: the ability to
counteract not only extinction but further evolution as well. Living systems live long owing to their ability to reproduce themselves with a high fidelity. Simple organisms (like bacteria) reach the
continued existence due to the high fidelity of individual genome replication. In organisms with a large genome and complex development, the achievable fidelity of DNA replication is not enough for
the precise reproduction of the genome. Such species must be capable of surviving and must remain unchanged in spite of the continuous changes of their genes. This problem has no solution in the frame
of asexual (""homeogenomic"") lineages. They would rapidly degrade and become extinct or blurred out in the course of the reckless evolution. The core outcome of the transition to sexual reproduction
was the creation of multiorganismic entity - biological species. Individual organisms forfeited their ability to reproduce autonomously. It implies that individual organisms forfeited their ability to
substantive evolution. They evolve as a part of the biological species. In case of obligatory sexuality, there is no such a thing as synchronic multi-level selection. Natural selection cannot select
anything that is not a unit of reproduction. Hierarchy in biology implies the functional predestination of the parts for the sake of the whole. A crucial feature of the sexual reproduction is the
formation of genomes of individual organisms by random picking them over from the continuously shuffled gene pool instead of the direct replication of the ancestor's genome. A clear anti-evolutionary
consequence of the sexuality is evident from the fact that the genotypes of the individuals with an enhanced competitiveness are not transmitted to the next generation. Instead, after mating with
""ordinary"" individuals, these genotypes scatter and rearrange in new gene combinations, thus preventing the winner from exploiting the success.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Pierre Antoine

The focus is on the fate of obligately sexual populations facing competition with one or
more obligately asexual clones. An early simulation model by Hamilton (Hamilton WD. 1980. Sex versus non-sex versus parasite. Oikos. 35:282-290.) suggested that parasites could be an important force
in selecting against asexual clones, leading to the persistence of sex. This result was consistent with a number of independent verbal models generated from 1975-1983. Conversely, the models by May
and Anderson (May RM, Anderson RM. 1983. Epidemiology and genetics in the coevolution of parasites and hosts. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 219:281-313.), which included more epidemiological detail,
suggested that parasites were an unlikely source of selection to favor sexual over asexual reproduction. Thus began an oscillation of opinion regarding the role of parasites in selection for sex. It
would seem at present that some of the differences of opinion over time stemmed from the different ways that models were constructed, including whether the sexual population was in competition with a
genetically diverse asexual population or a single clonal genotype. On theoretical grounds, parasite-mediated selection for sex seems more likely if the sexual population has options in genotypic
space that are not available to the clones. Models that incorporate more ecological realism also seem more favorable to the parasite theory of sex.","Lively, C. M."

dynamics. The individuals can be molecules, cells, viruses, multicellular organisms or humans. Whenever the fitness of individuals depends on the relative abundance of phenotypes in the population, we
are in the realm of evolutionary game theory. Evolutionary game theory is a general approach that can describe the competition of species in an ecosystem, the interaction between hosts and parasites,
between viruses and cells, and also the spread of ideas and behaviours in the human population. In this perspective, we review the recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics with a particular
emphasis on stochastic approaches in finite sized and structured populations. We give simple, fundamental laws that determine how natural selection chooses between competing strategies. We study the
well-mixed population, evolutionary graph theory, games in phenotype space and evolutionary set theory. We apply these results to the evolution of cooperation. The mechanism that leads to the
evolution of cooperation in these settings could be called ‘spatial selection’: cooperators prevail against defectors by clustering in physical or other spaces.","Nowak, Martin A. and Tarnita, Corina E. and Antal, Tibor"

In large societies, queens are expected to produce a pheromone that honestly signals her
dominance and/or fertility, to which workers respond by suppressing the development of their ovaries and by preventing other workers from reproducing (worker policing). However, what maintains the
honesty of such queen pheromones is still under discussion. The explanation that an honest queen signal evolves simply because it serves the interest of all colony members does not seem to hold, since
it is undermined by the fitness benefits of direct reproduction of workers at the individual level. A better explanation may be found in the idea that queen pheromones are difficult to produce for
subordinate individuals, either because policing workers attack them, or because queen pheromones are intrinsically costly chemicals. Here, I discuss some of the arguments for and against these
hypotheses and the evolutionary scenarios that each would lead to.","van Zweden, Jelle S."

Understanding the mechanisms that allow aggregations to form and restrict costs of cheating can
provide a resolution to the instability of social evolution. Aggregation in Tetrahymena thermophila is associated with costs of reduced growth and benefits of improved survival through “growth factor”
exchange. We investigated what mechanisms contribute to stable cooperative aggregation in the face of potential exploitation by less‐cooperative lines using experimental microcosms. We found that kin
recognition modulates aggregative behavior to exclude cheaters from social interactions. Long‐distance kin recognition across patches modulates social structure by allowing recruitment of kin in
aggregative lines and repulsion in asocial lines. Although previous studies have shown a clear benefit to social aggregation at low population densities, we found that social aggregation has very
different effects at higher densities. Lower growth rates are a cost of aggregation, but also present potential benefits when restricted to kin aggregations: slow growth and crowd tolerance allow
aggregations to form and permit longer persistence on ephemeral resources. Thus in highly dynamic metapopulations, kin recognition plays an important role in the formation and stability of social
groups that increase persistence through cooperative consumptive restraint.","Chaine, Alexis S. and Schtickzelle, Nicolas and Polard, Thierry and Huet, Michèle and Clobert, Jean"

(including density) include spatio-social relations between individuals; and (3) the phenomena observed on trial plots with a system of live traps are the same as those beyond the plot. However, the
home-range concept in small rodents is open to criticism in that: (1) observations point to much greater ranges of spatial activity in these animals than has been shown hitherto in plot-based studies
with systems of live traps; (2) there is great variability in the directions and extent of the spatial activity of small rodents; (3) observations suggest that what is regarded as the area of spatial
activity of an individual has limited information content since the ‘tenant’ makes use of the area via tracks and trails along which it moves. Transfers of studies on odour-related information in
small rodents from the laboratory to natural populations confirm the significance of odours in the life of these animals and in integrating their populations. It is possible that the need to leave
information in the environment (informational conditioning) provokes considerable locomotory and spatial activity in small rodents. Live traps with bait (food) limit the spatial activity of animals.
The set of traps in which an individual is caught thus represents not home range but trap range. A new paradigm for the ecology of small rodents should comprise the propositions that: (1) the function
of olfactory information is the integration of a population into an ecological system; (2) the maintenance of odour-mediated conditioning in the environment is one of the reasons for locomotor and
spatial activity; (3) the patchy distribution of food in the environment (including study plots with traps) gives rise to changes in the use made of space by individuals; (4) the phenomena observed on
research plots with live traps containing bait are different to those ongoing at the same time outside these areas. Such a paradigm requires reinterpretation of research results obtained hitherto as
well as the application of new research methods.","Andrzejewski, Roman"

emerges as ultimate self-interest. In this chapter we argue, however, that genuine altruism does exist and that it can be a result of natural selection. On the basis of experimental results we show
that individuals do behave genuinely altruistically in one-shot interactions when no one is watching. We argue that previous evolutionary theories fail to explain this finding, because their analysis
focuses on the biological concept of altruism only (i.e., altruism defined in terms of behavioral consequences), and leaves the altruistic intentions of actors aside. Referring to the commitment model
of Frank we argue that individuals have evolved dispositions for altruistic intentions. We hypothesize that (1) these stable altruistic intentions are recognizable, and (2) that altruists cooperate
electively with each other on the basis of their recognition abilities. Providing empirical evidence for our hypotheses, we argue that genuine altruism could have evolved through assortative processes

Inequalities did not exist, and in fact, nomadic hunter-gatherers worked very hard to make sure that no one could gain power or even too much prestige (Boehm 1993, 1999). Hunting and gathering proved
to be a highly adaptive form of social organization; and as long as populations remained small, there were few selection pressures on individuals to elaborate and differentiate new institutional
domains from kinship and to increase inequalities as a result of institutional differentiation. Two corporate units – nuclear family and band – were sufficient to organize the fifty or so individuals.
There were, no doubt, larger structures composed of relationships among bands sharing a language and elements of culture, such as values, religious beliefs, technologies, and common traditions; and in
these inter-band systems, hints of a more macro social formations can be found (Chase-Dunn and Mann 1998). But, as I emphasized in the last chapter, it was not until bands began to settle down that
selection pressures arising from population growth set into motion the evolution of the macro social realm. At first, settlements were few in number and often only temporary, but even then, pressures
were placed upon the members of these settlements to find new forms of production, new modes of political regulation, new means for protecting their territories, and other macrodynamic forces that
force people to develop more complex sociocultural formations, or die. And, as settlements eventually began to spread some 10,000–12,000 years ago, the power of these forces became that much greater.","Turner, Jonathan H. and Turner, Jonathan H."

status. Chapter 1 establishes causation in the opposite direction, with a relatively low social status position leading to a relatively high discount rate. The method used is experimental, with 154
subjects interacting in high- or low-status assignments. The subsequent change in intertemporal preference is significantly determined by the status assignment. The effect is strongest among the
subjects who initially have higher discount rates and does not depend on the sex of the subject. This result implies low status consumers have higher discount rates and make worse financial choices
because of their low social status, a finding that must be addressed in the regulation of consumer financial products.The evolution of uniquely exaggerated traits in humans is a topic that generates
considerable interest and debate. In Chapter 2 I present an integrated theory that is based on the relationship between the individual and the group. This relationship involves diverse incentives---
rewards and punishments---being applied by societies to their members, creating an evolutionary force. While the implications of direct incentives have been considered previously, I propose an
indirect and potentially far more powerful incentive: social status. Through the awarding and withholding of social status, societies favor diverse psychological and morphological traits including
intelligence, knowledge, norm-following, language ability, singing ability, and altruism towards one's group. Social status grants individuals proximate benefits in social interactions and ultimate
benefits in inclusive fitness, at least in pre-industrial societies. Hence social status acts as a social incentive and is a component of a wider evolutionary force that I term prosocial selection. In
discussing the social bases of prosocial selection, I highlight both the desire of group members to have incentive systems that benefit themselves, and group selection, here the selection of groups
with fitter incentive systems. In discussing the psychological bases of prosocial selection, I highlight genetic predisposition, behavioral conditioning, awareness of intrinsic incentives, and
awareness of social incentives. Finally, I discuss the altruism generated through prosocial selection, termed social altruism, and contrast it with established theories of altruism. As a coherent
theory of the evolution of many human behaviors, prosocial selection requires a considered debate.Why are low-income households less likely to save than high-income households? In Chapter 3, I argue
the cross-sectional relationship is explained by low status consumers being more impulsive. Formal tests using the Survey of Consumer Finances support this Status and Impulsiveness Hypothesis, while
the Permanent Income Hypothesis and the Life Cycle Hypothesis are not supported. A decomposition of income allows me to determine the relative contributions of the different hypotheses towards the
Income-Savings relationship: the SIH explains 85\%; the PIH 14\%; and the LCH 1\%.","Barradale, Nigel J."

These major evolutionary transitions have in common that independent
entities came together and cooperated and that finally a new entity was formed with a new fitness and a single evolutionary fate. Yet, the stable evolution of cooperation poses a classical Darwinian
puzzle: Organisms compete over reproduction and selfish individuals that reap the benefits of the cooperation without paying the costs (cheaters) can invade a population of cooperators and drive the
disappearance of cooperation. Social insects have become model organisms to study stable cooperation and how conflict between individuals is resolved. Here, I will first summarise what we have learned
from social insect research about the evolution of stable cooperation. Besides little-studied ecological factors that determine the benefits and costs of cooperation, two common mechanisms to prevent
the spread of cheaters have been identified: (i) common ancestry and aligned evolutionary interests mainly achieved through relatedness and (ii) enforcement mechanisms that make cheating costly. Then,
I will show that similar mechanisms have evolved at other levels of the biological hierarchy that favour cooperation. Thirdly, I will present the multilevel selection approach, which promises to be a
useful tool to study evolution at multiple selection levels. I will end by showing how a multilevel selection approach in future research might help to quantify benefits and costs of cooperation, so
that insect societies and all major evolutionary transitions alike are being recognised as more than the sum of their components.","Korb, Judith"

subsocial ancestors. Striking overlap occurs in the genes controlling caste and the shift of parental care to offspring via heterochrony, suggesting ecological pressures lead to co-option of similar
developmental mechanisms. There is also overlap in factors that predispose groups to eusociality, including extended parental care, defense of and the inheritance of a valuable nest, and enhanced
direct and indirect benefits from cooperative behavior. However, differences in developmental paths and ecological traits are also informative, such as the evolution of the soldier form and adult
workers. Multiple selective processes may favor eusociality over alternatives, but the degree to which each process was involved in eusocial evolution may have varied in each taxon. Reduced emphasis

(emancipatory narrative) or domination (critical narrative). Yet such presentations rarely rely upon detailed empirical work. Remarkably, International Relations (IR) scholars are paying little
attention to the local power effects of global discourses. This research takes issue with a key but under-studied discourse - Community Participation (CP) - in the protection of biodiversity. The
first case study is located in the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia and relates to corals. The second is in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world's largest wetland. Data were collected over four months of
fieldwork, using face-to-face interviews, participant observation, focus groups and written material. To capture a broader diversity of power mechanisms, a grid drawn from recent works in IR was
mobilised for the first time in this type of study. An analytical framework was also built that allows testable implications to be derived from macro-narratives and compared with micro-data. Rather
than engendering empowerment, it appears that CP has essentially set in motion various containment dynamics affecting local stakeholders. Yet, while our data impressively fit the critical narrative,
they also underscore its fragilities and contingency. At local levels, global governance discourses can no longer be seen as ""singular and accepted"", but rather as ""contested and reinterpreted"". They
do not produce either emancipation or domination per se. They are most fruitfully analysed as tools thrown into local arenas which rent-seeking actors scramble to seize and use for their own ends.
This significance of local dynamics undermines notions of North-South dependency or global governmentality. Data favour a hegemony model of the exercise of power that works through alliances and
compromises amongst global and local groups within what we call ""power formations"".","Charnoz, Olivier"

riposted that selection among groups rarely overrides within-group selection. Hamilton showed that altruism can evolve through kin selection. How strongly does group selection influence evolution?
Following Price, Hamilton showed how levels of selection interact: group selection prevails if Hamilton's rule applies. Several showed that group selection drove some major evolutionary transitions.
Following Hamilton's lead, Queller extended Hamilton's rule, replacing genealogical relatedness by the regression on an actor's genotypic altruism of interacting neighbours' phenotypic altruism.
Price's theorem shows the generality of Hamilton's rule. All instances of group selection can be viewed as increasing inclusive fitness of autosomal genomes. Nonetheless, to grasp fully how
cooperation and altruism evolve, most biologists need more concrete concepts like kin selection, group selection and selection among individuals for their common good.","LEIGH Jr, E. G."

Here we show that this is not the
case. Instead, inclusive fitness considerations rest on fragile assumptions, which do not hold in general. The quantitative analysis of kin selection relies completely on inclusive fitness theory. No
other theory has been proposed to discuss kin selection. We show the limitations of inclusive fitness theory. We do not discuss implications of kin selection that might exist independent of inclusive
fitness theory. We set up a general calculation for analyzing mutation and selection of two strategies, A and B, and then derive the fundamental condition for one strategy to be favored over the
other. This condition holds for any mutation rate and any intensity of selection. Subsequently, we limit our investigation to weak selection, because this is the only ground that can be covered by
inclusive fitness theory. For weak selection, we show that the natural selection interpretation is appropriate for all cases, whereas the kin selection interpretation, although possible in several
cases, cannot be generalized to cover all situations without stretching the concept of “relatedness” to the point where it becomes meaningless. Therefore we have a general theory, based on natural
selection and direct fitness, and a specific theory based on kin selection and inclusive fitness. The general theory is simple and covers all cases, while the specific theory is complicated and works
only for a small subset of cases. Whenever both theories work, inclusive fitness does not provide any additional insights. Criticisms of inclusive fitness theory have already been raised by population
geneticists and mathematicians (CavalliSforza and Feldman 1978 and Karlin and Matessi 1983). The present criticism is based on a game theoretic perspective in structured populations which has been
developed recently. The extra complication of inclusive fitness theories arises from the attempt to bring into the discussion increasingly abstract notions of ‘relatedness’ when it is not natural to
do so. This situation is not particular to theory. Hunt (2007) citing Mehdiabadi et al (2003) points out that “increasingly complex scenarios are required to keep recent empirical data within the
theoretical construct of haplodiploidy-based maximization of inclusive fitness.” The fact that inclusive fitness calculations are more complicated than direct fitness calculations has been accepted by
theoreticians such as Rousset and Billiard (2000) and Taylor et al (2006). As complicated as inclusive fitness is to calculate, it is even more complicated to measure empirically. Only very few

This
concept, if valid and pursued, could have a significant effect on efforts to combat aging processes by providing additional targets for potential intervention. A complex life span regulation system
implementing purposely programmed (adaptive) aging provides a better match to experimental evidence than the more popular nonprogrammed theories. The primary objection has historically been that
adaptive aging is “impossible” because it is not supported by the mechanisms of the evolution process. This argument was once generally accepted. However, more recently a number of alternatives to
classical evolutionary mechanics theory have been proposed that support purposely programmed aging. These alternatives were developed in response to observed issues other than aging and include group
selection, kin selection, evolvability, and geneoriented evolutionary mechanics theories. This paper shows how one of the alternatives, evolvability theory, supports adaptive aging, and also presents
arguments showing how evolvability theory can overcome specific objections put forward by proponents of classical evolutionary mechanics theory. The underlying issue, the evolutionary value of life as
a function of age relative to reproductive maturity, has now endured unresolved for 150 years. Four different concepts still have adherents and each has corresponding dependent theories of biological
aging. Lack of resolution is clearly interfering with efforts toward understanding aging and producing treatments for age-related conditions. Arguments are presented to the effect that many non-

personal needs and desires against the demands and requirements of their groups. Some never sink too deeply into the larger collective, for they remain individualists who are so self-reliant that they
refuse to rely on others or concern themselves with others’ outcomes. Other people, in contrast, put the collective’s interests before their own personal needs, sacrificing personal gain for what is
often called “the greater good.” Many problems in modern life can be traced, at least in part, to the basic issue of the tension between the individual and the greater good. Leaders must make choices
that will yield benefits for the constituents, but in most cases these choices will leave some members of the collective unsatisfied. In the political arena, those who occupy different positions on
the liberal-conservative continuum have very different views on the rights of individuals, and the rights of the collective. In business, questions of corporate responsibility arise in debates over
shareholder rights and responsibility to the community where the corporation is","Forsyth, Donelson R. and Hoyt, Crystal L."
3,hui_social_2010,"Social {Brain}, {Distributed} {Mind}",2010-01-01,"THE ‘PROBLEM OF ALTRUISM’ has remained a thorn in the side of evolutionary biology since Darwin. In On the origin of species (1860), Darwin clearly recognized that the widespread existence of
altruistic behavioural adaptations was a potential problem for his theory of natural selection. The general problem is that, if nature is ‘red in tooth and claw’ and natural selection produces
adaptations by virtue of competitive elimination of the less fit, how could it produce the many examples of cooperation found in nature in which individuals sacrifice some degree of fitness for
another? Since Darwin’s time, evolutionary biologists have tried to explain altruism within the natural selection framework. This has resulted in many different efforts to explain how altruism could
be maintained under selection. These many theories all appear to successfully demonstrate ways that altruistic behaviours might be sustained against ‘invasion’ by non-altruistic alternatives. These
are relevant to our approach, but only as post hoc adaptive consequences of the emergence of altruism. We will argue below that the standard natural selection approach does not do an adequate job of
explaining the origins of such adaptations. The selection framework itself is an incomplete explanation for the evolution of altruism because it necessarily avoids answering the question of how
altruistic behaviours initially arise in a non-altruistic context, and instead explains how they might be stabilized or modified with respect to alternatives in a given environment. This is because
natural selection theory is intrinsically agnostic to how a given trait initially arises. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the question of how modification of traits is generated is entirely
irrelevant. This agnosticism can lead to the expectation that random mutation, recombination and genetic drift are sufficient mechanisms to explain the creativity that is evident in evolution. It has
been easy to avoid addressing the question of the source of variant forms in contexts where a new adaptation can be traced to prior Proceedings of the British Academy 158, 181‐203. © The British

The moral, social, emotional, and explanatory components that make up complex religious systems offer both evolutionary
benefits and costs. Evolutionists who propose functional accounts of religion argue that it offers adaptive benefits that outweigh the costs. Theorists who propose nonfunctional accounts view religion
as a byproduct of interactions among nonreligious cognitive adaptations and environments. Others argue that religion evolved via memetic transmission, which allows maladaptive features to persist.
These maladaptive features may be anachronisms that were functional in the past but are detrimental to fitness in modern contexts. A thorough review reveals that work guided by these different
perspectives is driven by divergent research questions that ultimately complement one another to offer a more comprehensive evolutionary account of the complexity, variety, and durability of religious

This fact creates an impression of very
intensive natural selection. Only the reproductive part of population survives, i.e., passes natural selection. This fraction is many times smaller than the entire population. However, every selection
vector, determined by abiotic factors, predators, parasites, competition, etc. leads to selection of individuals adapted only to this particular set of biogeocenotic factors. Such selection does not
prevent but also does not favor the accumulation of genetic variants with a high adaptive value; it only eliminates those insufficiently fit. The second factor limiting the selection efficiency is low
heritability of behavioral, physiological and morphological characters, on which the elimination or survival of organisms mostly depends. The broad reaction norm of such characters provides non-
evolutionary adaptation in the course of transformation or development of new ecosystems. Low efficiency of natural selection is responsible for the low rate of coherent evolution, i.e. co-adaptation
of the species within communities. Fast, or incoherent, evolution is caused either by the appearance of a new unbalanced selection vector, or by destruction of the existing counterbalanced system
which supports the evolutionary stasis in established ecosystems.","Severtsov, A. S."

problem, and assuming that offspring behave identically to their parents, only those behaviors linked to reproductive success will survive, and less reproductively successful behaviors will disappear
at exponential rates. When the uncertainty in reproductive success is systematic, natural selection yields behaviors that may be individually sub-optimal but are optimal from the population
perspective; when reproductive uncertainty is idiosyncratic, the individual and population perspectives coincide. This framework generates a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, and the simplicity and
generality of our model suggest that these derived behaviors are primitive and nearly universal within and across species.","Brennan, Thomas J. and Lo, Andrew W."

maintained by selection operating between groups or populations. Here, I review our current understanding of the evolution of mammalian societies, focusing, in particular, on the evolution of
reproductive strategies in societies where one dominant female monopolizes reproduction in each group and her offspring are reared by other group members. Recent studies of the life histories of
females in these species show that dispersing females often have little chance of establishing new breeding groups and so are likely to maximize their inclusive fitness by helping related dominants to
rear their offspring. As in eusocial insects, increasing group size can lead to a progressive divergence in the selection pressures operating on breeders and helpers and to increasing specialization
in their behaviour and life histories. As yet, there is little need to invoke group-level adaptations in order to account for the behaviour of individuals or the structure of mammalian groups.","Clutton-Brock, Tim"

and of cultural evolutionary theory can be mutually beneficial. Social psychology provides cultural evolution with a set of empirically verified microevolutionary cultural processes, such as
conformity, model-based biases, and content biases, that are responsible for specific patterns of cultural change. Cultural evolutionary theory provides social psychology with ultimate explanations
for, and an understanding of the population-level consequences of, many social psychological phenomena, such as social learning, conformity, social comparison, and intergroup processes, as well as
linking social psychology with other social science disciplines such as cultural anthropology, archaeology, and sociology.","Mesoudi, Alex"

was like a coral, where living surface branches were supported by masses of dead branches. In phylogenetic trees, organismal or molecular lineages coalesce back to a lucky universal ancestor whose
descendents are found in current lineages and which coexisted with other, now‐extinct lineages. HGT complicates the reconstruction of a universal ancestor; genes in a genome can have different
evolutionary histories, and even infrequent gene transfer will cause different molecular lineages to coalesce to molecular ancestors that existed in different organismal lineages and at different
times. HGT, as well as symbiosis, provides a mechanism for integrating and expanding the organizational level on which natural selection acts, contributing to selection at the group and community
level.","Olendzenski, Lorraine and Gogarten, J. Peter"

A combination of ani- mal tracking
and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative
statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird move- ments are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light- based geolocation,
while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of char- acterizing the millions of km 2 of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes
result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be consid- ered:
this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are cen- tral place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined
by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spa- tial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be mod- eled
as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects
general- ized additive models). At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.

Social psychological research, in fact, shows that it affects
stereotyping, identification process, and intergroup bias. Previous research has also shown that group entitativity is not a positive or negative group attribute per se; rather, it depends on the
context and the relationship between the perceiver and the group. While enhancing entitativity leads to worse expectations about the out-group actions, high entitativity is a valued characteristic
when associated with an ally or with the in-group. Indeed, enhancing in-group entitativity leads to stronger in-group identification. The specific reasons for why this is the case, however, remain to
be ascertained. What is good about in-group entitativity? In the present contribution we propose that in-group entitativity may lead to perceive the group as a real entity provided with intentions and
capacity for planned actions, notably ensuring the safety of its members by protecting them against external threats. We report two correlational studies conducted with American citizens (Study 1) and
Italian citizens (Study 2), showing that in-group entitativity is associated with a higher level of identification, attribution of intentionality, and perceived security provided by the in-group.
These findings were replicated in a third study-conducted with a role-play method on a fictitious scenario-in which entitativity was manipulated rather than measured. Study 3 also shows that
artificially increasing the perception of in-group entitativity enhances perceived safety in an international context and reduces the perception of threat from an out-group. Findings are discussed in
terms of possible implications for intergroup and international relations.","Sacchi, Simona and Castano, Emanuele and Brauer, Markus"

The male's tympanic membrane (TM) area approximates twice the area of the female's; however, similar size
differences in the area of the columellar footplate were not observed between the sexes. Hence, the male's hearing is expected to be more sensitive than the female's but this is not the case. Asking
what offsets the advantage of the large TM, we applied a series of experiments to the auditory system. Male and female audiograms based on stimulation with airborne sound and on both multi-unit
responses from the brain and alternating cochlear potentials (`microphonics') showed equal sensitivity and a small difference in frequency response; at low frequencies the male was more sensitive than
the female. Amputating the columella and stimulating the stump with mechanical vibration showed that for an equal microphonic response, the male's footplate vibrated with lower amplitude than the
female's footplate. Mechanically stimulating the TM of the intact ear replicated this result, excluding the involvement of the mechanical lever. The TM of the male weighs five times the TM of the
female, and artificial loading of the TM of either sex greatly reduced the ear's sensitivity. Hence, the male's excessive area ratio (TM to columellar footplate) is offset by the heavier cartilage
cushion on the male's TM, damping the TM's response to sound. This is corroborated by experimentally artificially loading the TM. The product of area ratio and footplate vibration amplitude would
result in similar stimulation of the inner ear in the two sexes.","Werner, Y. L. and Pylka, J. and Schneider, H. and Seifan, M. and Walkowiak, W. and Werner-Reiss, U."

However, it has recently been argued that
empirical studies on the evolution of parasite virulence in spatial populations show otherwise. In particular, it has been claimed that the evolution of lower virulence in response to limited parasite
dispersal provides proof of Wynne-Edwards’s idea of adaptation at the group level. Although previous theoretical work has shown that limited dispersal can favour lower virulence, it has not clarified
why, with five different suggestions having been given. Here we show that the effect of dispersal on parasite virulence can be understood entirely within the framework of inclusive fitness theory.
Limited parasite dispersal favours lower parasite growth rates and, hence, reduced virulence because it (1) decreases the direct benefit of producing offspring (dispersers are worth more than non-
dispersers, because they can go to patches with no or fewer parasites), and (2) increases the competition for hosts experienced by both the focal individual (‘self-shading’) and their relatives (‘kin
shading’). This demonstrates that reduced virulence can be understood as an individual-level adaptation by the parasite to maximize its inclusive fitness, and clarifies the links with virulence theory
more generally.","Wild, Geoff and Gardner, Andy and West, Stuart A."

preferred candidate than to supporters of the other Democratic candidate. The bias observed in June persisted into August, and disappeared only in early September after the Democratic National
Convention. We also observe a strong gender effect, with bias both appearing and subsiding among men only. This experimental study illustrates a dynamic change in bias, tracking the realignment of
real world conflict lines and public efforts to reconstitute group identity. The change in salient group identity we describe here likely contributed to the victory of Barack Obama in the 2008

prestige, propagates exponentially at second and third hand. - Wright, ""Genie and Organismic Selection,"" Evolution INTRODUCTION In the above quotes, both Charles Darwin and Sewall Wright bemoan the
power and persistence of misinterpretation. In both cases diese scientists were concerned with the treatment of their theories by the broader scientific community and die lay pubUc. Separated by more
than a century, these thoughts provide a background for the discussion of the theory of group selection as it developed in die mid- to latetwentieth century in the work of the English ecologist Vero
Copner Wynne-Edwards. In this chapter I examine the ways that the work of Theodosius Dobzhansky and SewaU Wright influenced Wynne-Edwards. It is well known to biologists and historians alike that
Wynne-Edwards developed a dieory of group selection in the postsynthesis period that generated a heated debate. What is not so well known is diat Wynne-Edwards was consciously constructing his theory
in a manner he thought consistent with Wright and Dobzhansky. Indeed, Wynne-Edwards conceived of his own work as an ecological naturalist's verification of the models of Wright, consistent with the
fieldwork of Dobzhansky. Although the ""hardened"" form of the modern synthesis may have ultimately focused research along particular individuafist Unes, this was not the only interpretation of the
canonical works that constituted the synthesis. Wynne-Edwards is almost universally presented as an outsider in evolutionary studies, as either a misguided simpleton or an outright crank.
Nevertheless, WynneEdwards saw himself as part of a natural continuation of the evolutionary synthesis, and he presented his work Ui ways that stressed his association with the architects of the
synthesis, particularly Theodosius Dobzhansky and SewaU Wright. These associations were more than simply rhetorical. Wynne-Edwards derived key ideas and practices from the architects. This association
is far more Ultimate and extensive than the secondary literature leads us to assume. Analysis of this association raises important questions about notions like ""insider"" and ""outsider"" or continuity
versus breaks in the synthesis historiography. BIOGRAPHY Vero Copner Wynne-Edwards was born in 1906 and later attended Leeds Grammar and Rugby Schools where he developed his early interest in
astronomy and natural history. While at Rugby, the young Wynne-Edwards was much impressed by some visiting lecturers, including JuUan Huxley. Wynne-Edwards noted in his diary, Huxley was one visitor
who lectured ""awfully well"" (1985, p. 488). Wynne-Edwards left Rugby in 1924 with hopes of Himalayan expeditions studying alpine fauna and flora. The headmaster and his father, however, had, perhaps
not surprisingly, more practical plans. The headmaster suggested die study of medicine so diat Wynne could act as an expeditionary doctor, and his father suggested further formal study. In die end,
Wynne entered New College, Oxford to read zoology in October of 1924 with Julian Huxley as his tutor. This relationship was to last only a year as Huxley accepted die chair of Zoology at King's
College London before the end of 1925. Huxley's successor was Charles Elton (a former student of Huxley himself). According to Wynne-Edwards, Elton's influence was to be much more specific and
enduring (1985, p. 490). A pioneer of animal ecology and the founder of the Bureau of Animal Population at Oxford University in 1932, Elton is credited as having Ut, after their first tutorial, an
interest in population ecology that burned for the rest of Wynne-Edwards's life. Much later, Elton became one of many biologists who dismissed Wynne-Edwards's theories. Wynne-Edwards graduated with
first-class honors in zoology in 1927 and became Senior Scholar of New College for 1927-1929. …","Borrello, Mark E."

I used this approach to quantify
the habitat usage of central place foraging black-browed albatrosses (BBA) from nine colonies, modelling population-level distribution as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference and
conspecific competition. Throughout breeding, BBA preferred neritic waters, steeper bathymetry, and, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures. BBA from South Georgia also preferred highly
dynamic oceanic waters. Foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, presumably to reduce intraspecific competition. Although such competition is often invoked
to explain observed colony sizes, by accounting for travel costs, I demonstrate a strong relationship between the sizes of regional populations and the availability, accessibility and productivity of
neritic waters, supporting the hypothesis that seabird populations are constrained by breeding season food availability. In response to this constraint, albatrosses have evolved to exploit
energetically efficient gliding flight, allowing them to access prey 100-1000s of km from their colonies. Hence, I used satellite tracking and activity data to quantify the effects of relative wind
speed on the flight speed of four albatross species. Groundspeed was linearly related to the wind speed in the direction of flight, its effect being greatest on wandering albatrosses, followed by BBA,
light-mantled and greyheaded albatrosses, and airspeeds were higher in males than females. Commuting birds tended to encounter headwinds during outward trips and tailwinds on their return, such that
return trips were faster. This supports the hypothesis that foraging upwind of the colony is more efficient but could also result from wind climate and the relative location of prey. The ability to
use tracking data to estimate spatial usage is timely given the acute threat currently posed to albatrosses by incidental fisheries mortality. I, Ewan David Wakefield, hereby certify that this thesis,

0,cluttonbrock_one_2009,One co evolutio {Structure} and function in mammalian societies,2009-01-01,"Traditional interpretations of the evolution of animal societies have suggested that their structure is a consequence of attempts by individuals to maximize their inclusive fitness within constraints
imposed by their social and physical environments. In contrast, some recent re-interpretations have argued that many aspects of social organization should be interpreted as group-level adaptations
maintained by selection operating between groups or populations. Here, I review our current understanding of the evolution of mammalian societies, focusing, in particular, on the evolution of
reproductive strategies in societies where one dominant female monopolizes reproduction in each group and her offspring are reared by other group members. Recent studies of the life histories of
females in these species show that dispersing females often have little chance of establishing new breeding groups and so are likely to maximize their inclusive fitness by helping related dominants to
rear their offspring. As in eusocial insects, increasing group size can lead to a progressive divergence in the selection pressures operating on breeders and helpers and to increasing specialization
in their behaviour and life histories. As yet, there is little need to invoke group-level adaptations in order to account for the behaviour of individuals or the structure of mammalian groups.","Clutton‐Brock, T."
50,foster_defense_2009,A {Defense} of {Sociobiology},2009-01-01,"To counter recent claims that sociobiology is in disarray or requires reformulation, I discuss the semantics, theory, and data that underlie the field. A historical perspective is used to identify the
cause of current debates. I argue that semantic precision is required in discussing terms such as kin selection, group selection, and altruism, but once care is taken, the objections to the unity of
theoretical sociobiology largely evaporate. More work is required, however, to understand group adaptation, which might be taken to be the process of optimizing phenotypes that is driven by group,
rather than individual, context. From the empirical perspective, the eusocial insects with their fixed division between work and reproduction are often a sounding board in discussions. Here, one finds
clear evidence for the role of kin selection and relatedness in both the origin of eusociality and its maintenance. Data from other systems including the social vertebrates, microorganisms, and even
plants also support the role of relatedness and particularly family life in the evolution of cooperation and altruism. These data, however, in no way invalidate the claim that group selection is also
a central process in social evolution and I discuss the empirical evidence for group selection. The foundations of sociobiology are solid and the future should build on these foundations. Exciting new
areas include the importance of community and species-level selection in evolution and elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie social traits.","Foster, K. R."

two broad classes of pathogen traits that can be targeted by drugs or vaccines. The first class, consisting of traits that benefit the individual organisms bearing them, causes a strong evolutionary
response and the rapid emergence of drug resistance. The second class, consisting of traits that benefit groups of pathogen organisms including the individual provider, causes a weaker evolutionary
response and less drug resistance. Although most previous drug development has targeted the first class, it would be advantageous to focus on the second class as targets for drug and vaccine

birds shared the same variants at the different levels. We also performed recordings in different locations within night roosts. The dialects recorded in the roosts were the same as those recorded at
nest sites during the day and they were not distributed randomly within roosts: birds from the same geographical diurnal origin would gather and stay together, either because they arrived together or

traditionally considered to be opposites in (non-evolutionary) psychology, they may ultimately function similarly. The present paper summarizes a novel theory of social dominance, exemplifies its

Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a different approach, specifying social effects on trait values
rather than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for the degree of multilevel selection, which is the
natural partner of relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one or the other factor. Moreover, response is
symmetric in relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product of relatedness and the degree
of multilevel selection. With IGEs, however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection, IGEs are a key element
in the genetical theory of social evolution.","Bijma, P. and Wade, M. J."

arid‐adapted species, the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus Licht., Gerbillidae, Rodentia), as a measure of chronic stress in high, low, and recovering population densities. Results showed yearly
differences in the seasonal means of CORT, with the highest concentrations in the year of the highest population density. Analysis of year‐specific relationships revealed a positive correlation
between mean CORT and total precipitation in January and February and a negative correlation with precipitation in March. In the beginning of spring, when gerbils were in maximum reproductive effort,
CORT correlated positively with the saturation of burrow systems and with the number of adult females with an adult male. A linear stepwise regression of CORT in individual males in spring seasons of
all 6 yr combined after removal of year effects revealed that CORT depended positively on the number of females associated with a single male but negatively on the abundance of annual herbs.
Disappearance of adult males was not related to CORT in most cases. We found no correlation between overall mortality from season to season and mean CORT in either spring (March–May) or fall. In fact,
we found a highly negative correlation between mean CORT and the proportion of disappeared males at the beginning of spring. Only at the high population density when cases of probable catastrophic
mortality of all adults in the group were excluded was CORT of individual males related positively to their disappearance during the summer drought. Our results suggest that desert rodents with
irregular population fluctuations are more sensitive to suppression by external factors than by density‐dependent mortality mediated by stress. The favorable feeding and climatic conditions may have
compensated for density‐dependent increases of CORT and the negative effects it might have had on survival.","Rogovin, Konstantin A. and Randall, Jan A. and Kolosova, Irina E. and Moshkin, Mikhail P."

priori laws that explain why evolution on Earth has taken the direction of the major evolutionary trends and transitions instead of any other direction. Recently, however, major life‐history trends
and transitions have been explained as inevitable because of a deterministic selection that unfolds from the energetic state of the organism and the density‐dependent competitive interactions that
arise from self‐replication in limited environments. I describe differences and similarities between the historical and deterministic selection processes, illustrate concepts using life‐history models
on large body masses and limited reproductive rates, review life‐history evolution with a wider focus on major evolutionary transitions, and propose that biotic evolution is driven by a universal
natural selection where the long‐term evolution of fitness‐related traits is determined mainly by deterministic selection, while contingency is important predominately for neutral traits. Given
suitable environmental conditions, it is shown that selection by energetic state and density‐dependent competitive interactions unfolds to higher level selection for life‐history transitions from
simple asexually reproducing self‐replicators to large bodied organisms with senescence and sexual reproduction between males and females, and in some cases, to the fully evolved eusocial colony with
thousands of offspring workers. This defines an evolutionary arrow of time for open thermodynamic systems with a constant inflow of energy, predicting similar routes for long‐term evolution on similar

As a result, practitioners of artificial evolution have encountered difficulties in
predicting, analysing, or even understanding the outcome of their experiments. In particular, the concept of evolutionary ""progress"" (whether in the sense of performance increase or complexity growth)
has given rise to much debate and confusion. After a careful description of the mechanisms of evolution and natural selection, we provide usable concepts of performance and progress in coevolution. In
particular, we introduce a distinction between three types of progress: local, historical, and global, which we suggest underlies much of the confusion that surrounds coevolutionary dynamics.
Similarly, we provide a comprehensive answer to the question of whether an ""arrow of complexity"" exists in evolution. We introduce several methods to detect and analyse performance and progress in
coevolutionary experiments. We propose a statistical measure (Fitness Transmission) to detect the presence of adaptive Darwinian evolution in a reproducing population, based solely on genealogic
records; we also point out the limitations of a popular method (the Bedau-Packard statistics of evolutionary activity) for this purpose. To test and illustrate our results, we implement a rich
experimental system, inspired by the seminal work of Karl Sims, in which virtual creatures can evolve and interact under various conditions in a physically realistic three-dimensional (3D)
environment. To our knowledge, this is the first complete reimplementation and extension of Sims' results. We later extend this system with the introduction of physical combat between creatures, also
a first. Finally, we introduce Evosphere, an open, planet-like environment in which 3D artificial creatures interact, reproduce and evolve freely. We conclude our discussion by using Fitness
Transmission to detect the onset of adaptive evolution in this system.","Miconi, Thomas"

extends from mid-April to early July, but the onset, which is well synchronized, varies from year to year, probably depending on the spring temperature. One-year-olds lay the first clutch about a week
later than older birds. Within a group of females there is a constancy in the laying order of first clutches from year to year. The rank of any given female seems to depend on an individual
temperature threshold, which is reached four to seven days before laying, but other factors must play a role. The interval between the disappearance of a clutch or brood and the laying of the next
clutch varies from four to six days depending on the stage at which the previous brood was lost. Beyond the 17th or 18th day of life the chicks of one brood no longer prevent the laying of a new
clutch. No factors influencing the end of the season could be found. On average, Skylarks lay 2.7 clutches per year (range 1–5). Three successful broods seems to be the maximum.   Average c/size is
3.69 eggs (range 3–5). The c/size varies with successive clutches, from 3.3 for first, to 4.0 for third clutches. Individual females tend to lay clutches of a characteristic size. No difference could
be found between the clutches of one-year and older birds, Females which retain the same territory from year to year show more consistency in clutch size than those which change territories. Data from
different geographical locations in Europe suggest a cline from northwest to southeast of increasing clutch size. Clutch size does not seem to be affected by temperature. The variability of egg size
and shape is discussed.   68\% of the eggs laid hatched (incubation period 11 days) and 67\% of the young hatched left the nest on the 8th day. About 90\% of the eggs and young lost were taken by
predators. No consistent seasonal differences in nest mortality could be found, nor between c/3 and c/4. An incidental experiment suggests that predation of Skylark nests is density dependent. The
success of one-year-old females in rearing nest-leaving young is lower than that of older birds (15\% compared with 51\%). From observations of the feeding behaviour of the parents it is estimated
that about 25\% of the young survived to flying age (16th day of life), and about 10\% reached independence (30th day).   Skylarks, males more than females, exhibit a strong site-tenacity. One-year-
old birds tend to return to the birthplace area. Associated with site-tenacity the Skylarks show mate-faithfulness.   Of 36 pairs 17 remained faithful from one year to the next. During a breeding
season mate-faithfulness is practically absolute. There is a correlation between the breeding success of a pair and the likelihood of the pair remaining together the following year.   Mean annual
adult mortality was 33.5\%, with little variation except in 1962/63 (47\%-the result of a hard winter). After reaching independence, the first-year mortality of juveniles was estimated to be 38\%, on
the assumption that the population remains constant in numbers. The average “life-expectancy” of a newly laid egg is about 3 1/2 months and that of a newly hatched young about 5 months. The mortality
sources for adult Skylarks are briefly discussed.   Skylarks have a well-developed territorial behaviour which is an important mechanism in regulating the maximum breeding density. In conjunction with
site-tenacity, habitat preferences and social attraction, it is capable of regulating the reproductive rate of the total population by excluding a proportion of birds from breeding when the population
numbers are high.","Delius, Juan D."

Outside the islands the species occurs
over the northern parts of the Humboldt Current.     Two colonies were studied in detail (1970–1971). At the start of a season, males returned first to the colonies and defended a small territory.
Copulation occurred without any elaborate ceremony and the female spent little time on land before laying. There was no fixed nest-site, even within a season, and birds moved their eggs considerable
distances. This resulted in heavy egg losses. Younger birds bred later than older birds and laid longer but narrower eggs. The average incubation spell varied from four to five days at the extremes of
the incubation period to 19 days in the middle. The average incubation and fledging periods were 60 and 167 days respectively. Pairs which lost an egg sometimes adopted the abandoned egg of another
bird and successfully reared the chick. Most pairs nested in both seasons.     Nesting success was extremely variable, both between years and between colonies. Between 1961 and 1971 at Punta Suarez,
virtually no young were reared in four seasons. Even in 1970–71, where nesting success was good, some groups of birds deserted their eggs en masse whereas in neighbouring areas up to 80\% of the pairs
reared young.     The main foods of the young were squid and fish.     Birds did not moult wing and tail feathers at the breeding colonies, and about 50\% retained some primaries for more than one
season, suggesting that successful pairs had difficulty in fitting in a complete moult between breeding attempts. Old feathers were normally found among the inner primaries and at the next moult were
preferentially replaced, though adjacent newer feathers were sometimes retained for another season.     Some birds bred in their fourth years, but most not until a year or two older. Immatures were
present at the colonies late in the breeding cycle, the youngest returning latest and remaining until the last young fledged.     Survival of adults and young averaged at least 95\% and 93\% per annum
over many years. Adults and young ringed in 1961 survived equally well.     The significance of the timing of the return of immatures and of the large-scale desertion of eggs, apparently not due to
food shortage or disturbance, is discussed.","Harris, M. P."

were about to leave the island and recapturing them in later years.     The weight of the young at fledging and the date at which they leave affect their chances of survival; overall, as many as 30\%
of the young birds may survive to reach breeding age, which is thought to be normally about 5–6 years. Adult mortality varies between wide limits of about 5 and 20\%, but juvenile survival appears to
be of about the right order to balance adult losses.     The significance of the one-egg clutch is discussed. At the normal time of laying the female may not be able to obtain sufficient food to form
a second egg. A two-egg clutch, laid at a later date, would not produce more surviving young since these would fledge too late in the season to have a good chance of survival.     The advantage of
leaving the island at a heavy weight is discussed, and it is concluded that the fat stores laid down give heavy young a greater chance than light young of migrating a long distance without food. It is
possible that the young may even reach their winter quarters (off Brazil) without having to feed on passage if they depart with enough stored fat.","Perrins, C. M. and Harris, M. P. and Britton, C. K."

We
then draw on the historical record to identify the behavioral rules of conduct, and the system supporting those rules that were found in the early state. The proposal tested here is that in
traditional societies the behavioral rules of conduct and the systems that support them (e.g., processes for identifying guilt, punishing offenders, enacting legislation, preventing conflict) are
aimed at promoting enduring, cooperative relationships among individuals who are identified as kin through common ancestry. The assumption underlying this proposal is that once human females increased
their investment in offspring, cultural strategies to protect those offspring became more important. A moral system, which is the term we use to refer to the early system of behavioral codes,
protected offspring by turning conspecific threats into the protectors, providers, and educators of children. It did this by creating a strong kinship system, the members of which were bound by common
ancestry (actual or metaphorical), thus tying individuals into enduring, cooperative relationships by using culture to encourage them to honor ongoing duties to one another. This kinship-based moral
system is significantly different from that found in societies in which the majority of interactions are with non-kin, interactions often center on the exchange of good and services, and traditions
have largely been broken down. We refer to this second system as a system of law and argue that this distinction between moral and legal systems has implications for attempts to explain the

important phenomenon in nature and that symbiogenesis is a major source of innovation in evolution; (5) an array of new, more advanced game theory models, which support the growing evidence that
cooperation is commonplace in nature and not a rare exception; (6) new research and theoretical work that stresses the role of nurture in evolution, including developmental processes, phenotypic

are there no male workers in Hymenoptera? I briefly trace the origins of kin selection back to Darwin and then consider the explanations of mutualism, group selection, parental manipulation, and kin
selection and its variant 'green beard' alleles. I stress that in the kin selection equation, however written, relatedness is deeply intertwined with ecology so that both are essential. Kin selection
does remain unchallengeable but, for some, the role of male haploidy has lost favour recently despite several modelling efforts all finding that it favours the evolution of eusociality. Sex allocation
is deep at the heart of the evolution of hymenopteran advanced eusociality, indicating the interacting roles of population genetics and general biology. Modellers have also found no reason for a lack

The best thresholds characterizing species ranged 22–72 dB sound pressure level at 0.5–1.0 kHz. Direct acoustic stimulation of the columella footplate elevated thresholds by 25–50 dB. Intraspecific
CAP sensitivity was primarily affected by body length in Eublepharis macularius, but by tympanic-membrane velocity in Oedura marmorata. The chief factor determining middle-ear function (difference in
CAP sensitivity before and after middle-ear ablation) was body length in both species. A secondary factor was the middle-ear hydraulic lever ratio in E. macularius, but the mechanical lever in O.
marmorata. When intra- and interspecific data were compared, the relation of CAP thresholds to body size in E. macularius resembled the interspecific regression. The intraspecific regression of
auditory sensitivity over tympanic membrane velocity in O. marmorata differed from that calculated interspecifically. Hence, the evolutionary contribution to size effects on CAP sensitivity exceeds
the ontogenetic contribution. Putatively, body length affects CAP sensitivity through absolute sizes of tympanic membrane and columella footplate. These newly discovered effects join those of the
hydraulic lever and (interspecifically) hair-cell number to improve the hearing of larger species that vocally communicate across wider spaces, apparently throughout the Tetrapoda.","Werner, Yehudah L. and Montgomery, Lynda G. and Seifan, Merav and Saunders, James C."

passive and active assortment in the evolution of cooperation, and 3) describe why contingent movement in particular is likely to have played an underappreciated role in the evolution of cooperation.

INTRODUCTION Traditionally, debates about the mechanisms underlying the evolution of cooperation have focused on the relative importance of kin-selection, multilevel selection, reciprocity and complex
cognitive/behavioral strategies. Considering the controversy that tends to surround theories about the evolution of cooperation, it is relatively surprising that assortment plays a recognized role in
the operation of a wide variety of these proposed mechanisms. Assortment is a way of conceptualizing the proximity of individuals (or genes) of the same type within groups of interacting individuals.
Positive assortment, or simply assortment, is the aggregation of the same type within groups, while negative assortment is characterized by less similarity within groups than in the general
population. Kin selection (e.g., Hamilton, 1964a, b), group or multilevel selection (Maynard Smith, 1964; Price, 1970; Wilson, 1987), reciprocity (Axelrod, 1984; Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Trivers,
1971) and selection in structured populations such as those on lattices (e.g., Brauchli et al., 1999; Ifti et al., 2004; Nakamaru, 2006; Nowak and May, 1992) or graphs (e.g., Lehmann et al., 2007;
Ohtsuki et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2007) all operate on assortment. This section provides an overview of such theories of the evolution of cooperation, noting that assortment is a fundamentally
important aspect of the evolution of cooperation within these divergent approaches. Models of the evolution of cooperation draw on the formal tools of game theory (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944),
typically making use of social dilemma (Dawes, 1980) paradigms. Social dilemmas are characterized by a conflict between the individually optimal decision (to defect) and the collectively optimal
decision (to cooperate). Because of this conflict between the individually and collectively optimal behaviors, social dilemmas are excellent formal tools for exploring the evolution of social
behavior, capturing the tension in benefit optimization at different levels of organization. In dyadic models of cooperation, the prisoner’s dilemma and the hawks/doves (also called the snowdrift
game) are common (see Doebeli et al., 2005 for a review). Group based interactions are often modeled after public goods games (Ledyard, 1995) and the ‘tragedy of the commons’ (Hardin, 1968).
Explaining the evolution of cooperative behavior has been a long-term goal in theoretical evolutionary biology. Early field work on the evolution of cooperation focused on behaviors thought to be
group and species level adaptations (Wynne-Edwards, 1962; Wynne-Edwards, 1963). Formals models of the evolution of cooperation soon challenged this work, and the individual and gene based views which
focused on the average fitness of genes (Dawkins, 1976/1989; Maynard Smith and Price, 1973; Maynard-Smith, 1964; Williams, 1966) came to be more widespread and accepted than ‘good of the group’
approaches. A major component of this was the formalization of the idea of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a strategy that cannot be invaded by a mutant strategy when individuals randomly
encounter others in an infinite population (Maynard Smith and Price, 1973). It was, however, recognized that interactions are often not random in the natural world because of limited dispersal of
offspring and local interactions, which give rise to interactions with kin. This is captured in inclusive fitness and kin selection models, where individuals preferentially assort with and cooperate
with kin, allowing cooperation to evolve (Hamilton, 1964a, b; Maynard Smith, 1964). The fundamental mechanism underlying the operation of kin selection is the selection of genes for a trait
(cooperativeness) because of the positive effects the trait has on individuals that share the gene through common descent. The well known equation describing this effect is called “Hamilton’s Rule,” c
{\textless} b*r; it specifies the cost (c) to benefit (b) ratio required for altruism to evolve between individuals of varying degrees of relatedness (r). Multilevel/group selection has had a more
controversial history (see Sober and Wilson, 1998; Wilson, 1983; Wilson and Wilson, 2007). However, the fundamental features of multilevel selection are the same as those of kin selection: they
involve the selection of genes for cooperative traits because of positive effects on others that share (genes that code for) those traits (Maynard Smith, 1964; Price, 1970; Wilson, 1987; Wilson and
Wilson, 2007). The mathematics underlying group selection involve measuring the within vs. between group variance in a trait through the variance ratio or another index of assortment (e.g., Pepper,
2000). When there is variation between groups in cooperativeness of the members, the groups with a higher proportion of cooperators are more successful, at least transiently. It has been shown that
kin selection can be conceptualized ASSORTMENT IN SPACE AND TIME as special case of multilevel/group selection where ‘groups’ are made up of interacting kin (Queller, 1992). The role of reciprocity in
the evolution of cooperation has been the focus of much theoretical and empirical work (Axelrod, 1984; Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Bowles and Gintis, 2004; Boyd and Richerson, 1988; Fehr et al., 2002;
Gintis, 2000; Nowak and Sigmund, 1998a, b; Panchanathan and Boyd, 2003; Panchanathan and Boyd, 2004; Trivers, 1971). Reciprocity promotes cooperation through long-term benefits to the individual from
mutually cooperative repeated interactions. These cooperative interactions are possible without great risk to either partner if they each follow a reciprocal Tit-for-Tat strategy that copies the
behavior of their partner on the last round (Axelrod, 1984; Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981). A Tit-for-Tat strategy allows individuals to cooperate when interacting with cooperators and to switch to
defection if they encounter defectors, protecting Tit-for-Tat from exploitation, while simultaneously allowing for benefits from repeated interactions with cooperators. This ability to use past
behavior as a signal of likely future behavior results in higher long-term payoffs for cooperators compared to defectors. A variety of more complex and information intensive strategies have been
implicated in the evolution of cooperation. For example, relatively recent work has investigated the role of memory (Aktipis, 2006; Cox et al., 1999; deVos and Zeggelink, 1994; Mealy, 1996; Milinski
and Wedekind, 1998), reputation (Milinski et al., 2002), gossip (Nakamaru and Kawata, 2002), indirect reciprocity (Nowak and Sigmund, 1998a, b; Panchanathan and Boyd, 2003; Panchanathan and Boyd,
2004), commitment (Nesse, 2001), norm following (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004; Fehr et al., 2002), policing/punishment (Brandt et al., 2006; Fowler, 2005; Gardner and Westt, 2004) and tag-based
cooperation (Hammond and Axelrod, 2006; Spector and Klein, 2006) as possible mechanisms enabling the evolution of cooperation, particularly in humans. Like reciprocity, each of these strategies
increases the viability of cooperation through some form of signal processing that decreases uncertainty about a potential partner’s behavioral characteristics, allowing for an adaptive facultative
response to that information. Another area that has received attention is that of partner choice, or exit from interaction. Partner choice has been shown to be a potentially important influence on
cooperation in humans (Barclay and Willer, 2007; Boone and Macy, 1999; Orbell et al., 1984; Schuessler, 1989) and various models of partner choice have demonstrated the important role that partner
choice can play in the evolution of cooperation (Aktipis, 2004; Ashlock et al., 1996; Connor, 1992; Cox et al., 1999; Enquist and Leimar, 1993; Eshel and Cavalli-Sforza, 1982; Hamilton and Taborsky,
2005; Noe and Hammerstein, 1994; Vanberg and Congleton, 1992). As a result of this individual level partner choice behavior, assortment is promoted and partnerships/groups with more cooperators can
end up being more stable and producing more offspring, leading to greater success for cooperators. PREVIOUS FRAMEWORKS FOR COOPERATION Each of the approaches described above has contributed
importantly to our understanding of the evolution of cooperation. However, confusion arises when kin selection, group selection, reciprocity, partner choice, byproduct benefits and/or direct benefits
are conceptualized as alternative categories in which to place instantiations of evolved cooperation. These different approaches rely on the same fundamental principle: that genes having positive
effects on copies of themselves will be selected. When individuals with shared genes preferentially assort with one another, this can promote cooperation. In fact, the i","Aktipis, C. A."

(2008): Population ecology of the Great Tit Parus major in taiga for- est on Lake Ladoga coast. Avian Ecol. Behav. 14: 1-33. Studies done in 1979-1004 in Karelia showed that taiga
forests are suboptimal habitats for the Great Tit, where breeding density is low and proportion of yearlings among breeders is high. Laying dates depended on habitat and April air temperatures. Clutch
size was not related either to breeding density or to habitat. Yearlings bred earlier than older birds, laid more eggs and raised more fledglings. Age of males influenced timing of breeding but not
clutch size. It is assumed that in the study area external factors have a stronger impact on birds than their age, so that age-related variation is lacking or strongly transformed. On average, 47.8\%
pairs laid second clutches after a successful first breeding cycle. Breeding density or age composition of pairs did not influence the occurrence of second breeding cycle. Second cycle occurred more
often in forest stands with high specific diversity of trees. The mean air temperature in September was positively related to the occurrence of second broods. As many as 77\% of nests survived to
fledging, and 67.9\% of eggs laid produced fledglings. Breeding performance was not related to breeding density, habitat, age composition of the population, or timing of breeding. It was mainly
governed by partial nestling loss, proportion of nests lost and mean monthly temperature of May. A breeding pair produced on average 10 fledglings per season. This figure was related to breeding
success, occurrence of second clutches, and winter and spring weather. Low breeding density of Great Tits in the Ladoga area prevented development of density- dependent regulation mechanisms.
Therefore, reproductive strategy is aimed at achieving the maximum reproduction rate possible, limited only by the physiological capacity of birds and resources in the environment. Breeding density
was practically unrelated to breeding perfor- mance in the preceding year. It was governed by immigration rate and survival rate during the non-breeding season. Weather during the critical periods of
the annual cycle, i.e. during autumn and spring movements and during winter had a certain impact on breeding density.","Artemyev, A."

the marketing concept (Barksdale and Darden 1971; Houston 1986; McKitterick 1957), has led to a dramatic increase in the need to understand the consumer. While application of this market orientation
approach, especially in the forms of direct and relationship marketing, arguably brings multiple benefits to both consumers and firms (Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Narver and Slater 1990), it also
requires a large amount of consumer information in order to deliver value (Nowak and Phelps 1997). The widespread adoption of information technology (IT) has allowed firms to meet this need for
consumer information by vastly increasing the amount and types of information they collect (McCrohan 1989; Thomas and Maurer 1997). For firms, advances in IT have considerably enhanced the
institutionalization and utilization of the market orientation approach by providing the technological infrastructure to capture, analyze, and maintain large quantities of consumer information (Winer
2001). For consumers, though, the collection and analysis of their personal information has led to an increase in privacy concerns (Foxman and Kilcoyne 1993; Phelps, Nowak, and Ferrell 2000). While
most consumers welcome the increased convenience and personalization that these various marketing orientation approaches provide, many are concerned about the collection, use, and protection of their
personal information (Phelps et al. 2000; Rust, Kaman, and Peng 2002). Given the sharp increases in unsolicited promotions, incidences of identity theft, and the negligent loss of consumer information
by firms, these fears are not altogether unwarranted (Levy and Stone 2005). For many consumers, major privacy concerns fall into three main categories: (1) notification, (2) control, and (3) security.
First, many consumers want to be informed about the collection and use of their personal information by firms (Dommeyer and Gross 2003; Milne and Culnan 2004; Nowak and Phelps 1995), Second, consumers
want to feel that they have some control over the collection of their personal information and the sharing of this information among firms (Goodwin 1991; Milne and Boza 1999; Phelps et al. 2000).
Third, most consumers want some assurance that the personal information they provide to firms, especially online, and the storage of this information is secure (Hoy and Phelps 2003; Jones 1991;
Miyazaki and Fernandez 2000). Although multiple legal, commercial, and technological solutions have been proposed to address these concerns (Foxman and Kilcoyne 1993; Goodwin 1991; Phelps et al.
2000), the protection of consumer privacy remains a constant concern for consumers and a formidable challenge for businesses. In an attempt to understand these issues, consumer privacy research has
sought to define the concept of consumer privacy, outline the privacy expectations and strategies of both consumers and businesses, and examine the degree to which firm's are providing adequate
consumer privacy protection. While this body of research has provided us with valuable information concerning these issues, there currently does not exist a review that synthesizes and analyzes the
current state of consumer privacy research. Given the complexity of the topic and the diversity of issues that have been explored, we feel that a comprehensive review is necessary to refine our
understanding of this important topic and to take consumer privacy to a more advanced theoretical level. As a result, the purpose of this article is to examine the general concept of privacy in order
to situate and define the domain of consumer privacy, review the literature on consumer privacy in order to determine what we know, and provide directions for future research in order to address gaps

This revival has often been highly threatening to sociologists because it
is disproportionately based on evolutionary theorizing from biology, where selection works on individuals and their phenotypes (including their behavioral propensities), while populations are seen as
evolving. Darwinian notions of selection have always been part of sociological theorizing, particularly in human ecology. In this paper, we argue that there are limits as to how far models from
evolutionary theorizing in biology can be taken in the analysis of sociocultural evolution. A new and more distinctly sociological analysis of selection processes and the evolution of sociocultural
formations is needed. Indeed, sociology should not be threatened by evolutionary biology, but instead should seek to create its own approach to the evolution of sociocultural systems. We develop our
argument by answering four basic questions: What is evolution in the biotic and sociocultural universes? What is evolving? What are the units of selection in these universes? And, what is the nature
of selection in these universes? The answer to these questions highlights the limitations of applying evolutionary theory from biology to sociological analysis.",{Jonathan H. Turner} and {Alexandra Maryanski}
0,pradel_survival_2008,The survival of the kindest: a theoretical review and empirical investigation of explanations to the evolution of human altruism,2008-01-01,"Charles Darwin was concerned that his entire theory of evolution by natural selection might be negated by a phenomenon prevalent in a variety of species including humans; namely altruism. If natural
selection really favored the survival of the fittest, how could a strategy so irrational as to sacrifice oneself for the well-being of unrelated others survive? A number of scientists have contributed
valuable theories to elucidate the �paradox of altruism�. However, in spite of the merits of these theories, there is still dissension about the origins of some particular oddities in the altruistic
tendencies of humans, namely why humans act selflessly even when they are unobserved and when they are benefiting a stranger whom they will never meet again. The present doctoral thesis sheds light on
answers to the question how human altruism, with all its specific features, could evolve. In the first part, both prominent (e.g., kin selection, reciprocal altruism, etc.) and less recognized
theories on the evolution of altruism (e.g., green-beard altruism, the theory of the extended phenotype, etc.) are reviewed. Based on an integrative overview, it is analyzed how much of the altruism
puzzle has been solved yet and which specific phenomena are still open to conjecture. With the aim of adding new insights to the issue, the second part of this work presents three empirical studies
that investigate in how far prosociality might have been favored (1) by processes of assortation, i.e. the grouping of altruists, and (2) by mating strategies. Indeed, assortation may be invoked as an
explanation for the evolution of altruism, if the selfish advantage of egoistic individuals is out-competed by benefits of mutually cooperating altruists. However, to make assortation work as a driver
of the evolution of altruism, two prerequisites have to be fulfilled: first, individuals have to be able to distinguish altruists from egoists, and second, altruists have to elect like-minded
individuals for mutual cooperation. The first study investigates whether humans are really able to identify altruists based on first impression. To test this, judges watched 20-second silent video
clips of unknown target persons and were asked to estimate the behavior of these target persons in a dictator game, which measures prosociality. Estimates were significantly better than chance
indicating that humans can identify the altruistic dispositions of unknown persons. The second study investigates whether individuals, in genuine groups, can identify the altruistic tendencies of
their daily interaction partners. It further examines whether prosociality influences the formation of friendships in such that individuals assort themselves along the dimension of altruism. Students
of six secondary school classes played an anonymous dictator game that functioned as a measure of altruism. Afterwards and unannounced, the students had to estimate their classmates� decisions and did
so better than chance. Sociometry revealed that altruists were friends with more altruistic persons than were egoists. The results thus confirm the existence of the two prerequisites for the evolution
of altruism through assortation: the predictability of altruistic behavior and the association of altruists. However, although the theory of assortation may explain the evolution of altruism in
general, it does not explain the occurrence of inter-individual differences in altruism. The third study deals exactly with this matter. It investigates whether different levels of prosociality might
have evolved as a result of different mating strategies, namely inter-individual variations in the propensity to engage in either short-term mating or long-term mating. Specifically, it assumes that
prosociality is a necessity for acquiring a long-term partner, especially if an individual has to compensate for deficits in physical attractiveness. To find out whether this idea is true, the study
tested whether individuals look out for different levels of prosociality depending on whether they are searching for a short-term mate or a long-term mate. Judges watched short video-clips of target
persons and received additional information on the targets� prosociality. Judges were then asked to rate each of the target persons with regard to their desirability as a short-term and long-term
mate. While prosociality was a significant predictor for long-term desirability, it was irrelevant when subjects chose a short-term mate. The results suggest that although altruism is costly, at least
for some individuals it might be a wretched necessity to obtain access to mates and to reproduce. In the general discussion, the results of all three studies are consolidated. Conclusions are drawn as
to the consequences of these findings for the study of human altruism. Finally, directions for future research are presented.","Pradel, Julia"

manipulated space and food abundance, but used population densities far outside the range of natural densities. No experiments have tested the effects of population density on territory size and
individual behaviour in salmonids over a range of realistic densities, while keeping all other factors equal. Hence, I manipulated population density of juvenile rainbow trout at five levels (two,
four, eight, twelve, and sixteen fish) in artificial stream channels (1 x w = 1.47 m 2 ) while keeping per capita food supply constant. I tested the contrasting predictions that the territory size of
dominant fish (1) is not affected by population density; (2) decreases with population density as 1/n; or (3) decreases with population density but towards an asymptotic minimum size. Territories of
dominant fish in this experiment decreased with increasing population density before leveling off at the highest densities, and therefore seemed to support the prediction of an asymptotic minimum
size, as well as the hypothesis that territoriality can regulate populations of stream salmonids. At low densities dominant fish were despotic and defended most of the available space. However, as
fish abundance increased, dominants defended less space, and the social system switched from despotic to a territorial mosaic. My study has helped to clarify the role of territoriality in regulating
populations of stream dwelling salmonids which may have important implications for conservation and behavioral ecology.","Wood, Jacquelyn L. A."

Darwin launched this topic of inquiry with a surprisingly modern discussion of how fitness could be derived
from both personal reproduction (direct fitness) and the reproduction of family (indirect fitness), and the anarchist Petr Kropotkin forever wove ecology into sociobiology with his book on Mutual Aid.
From there, an eccentric group of protagonists took the helm and developed theories of social evolution with clear (although sometimes implicit) links to ecology. Here we provide a summary of the
foundational theory, including Hamilton's rule, neighbor- modulated fitness, inclusive fitness, and levels of selection; discuss the classification and semantics of social behaviors; and give a brief
overview of the various mecha- nisms that have been invoked to explain cooperation. Recently, models have emerged that frame the evolution of cooperation in an explicitly ecological context, including
the theories of reproductive skew, cooperation in viscous populations, and the tragedy of the commons. In particular, rates and patterns of dispersal strongly influence fit- ness, the costs and
benefits of sociality, and genetic relatedness in social groups. This is an exciting time for ecological sociobiology and there is a great need for studies that combine careful natural history with
social evolutionary theory.","Gardner, Andy and Foster, Kevin R."

In particular, extinction models aim at quantifying the risk of extinction of populations that are the subject of
conservation concerns. Many such models are developed as simulation models, although the behaviour of stochastic models incorporating various types of variability (such as demographic and
environmental stochasticity) can be complex and difficult to analyze. We present here, based on a simple example, a large class of stochastic models: Branching Processes. We summarize their key
explicit mathematical properties as extinction models, in particular, in conditions realistic for conservation biology, the so-called “quasi-stationarity” (certainty of extinction, existence of
stationary distribution of population size conditional on non-extinction, geometric distribution of time to extinction). Quasi-stationarity links decreasing populations and populations stabilized by
density-dependence on a continuum of annual extinction probability. We then develop approximations of the annual probability of extinction and illustrate them for the Amsterdam Albatross (Diomedea
amsterdamensis), a critically endangered species. As extinction models are clearly more useful for hierarchizing risks of extinction than for estimating in an absolute fashion a probability of
extinction, we hope our approach will open the way to sensitivity analyses of the risk of extinction.","Lebreton, Jean-Dominique and Gosselin, Frédéric and Niel, Colin"

the question of selection on multiple levels. An additional level of replication emerges when we consider routines within organizations and the social positions related to them. The analysis here
establishes that social organizations including business firms are often interactors. Such organizations are more than simply groups because of the existence of routines and social positions.
Accordingly, to understand firms and other organizations, we need more that a “dual inheritance” theory; we have to consider the replication of social positions and routines as well.","Hodgson, G. and Knudsen, T."

10,brandvain_evolution_2007,The evolution of competition and policing: opposing selection within and among groups,2007-01-01,"BackgroundAlthough selection favors exploitative competition within groups, a group of hypercompetitive individuals may be less productive than a cooperative group. When competition is costly for
group fitness, among-group selection can favor groups with 'policing' individuals who reduce within-group competition at a cost to their own fitness, or groups of individuals who restrain their
competitive intensity ('self policing'). We examine these possibilities in a series of explicit population-genetic models.ResultsBy comparing results from models of half and full sib structured
populations, we find that increased relatedness increases the strength of among-group selection against competition genotypes, and increases the strength of among group selection favoring policing
genotypes. However, the strength of selection favoring costly policing behavior also increases with increased levels of competition. When levels of competition and policing feedback on one another,
groups with lower levels of relatedness can favor higher levels of costly policing.ConclusionThe result of the joint selection on policing and competition leads to results different from those based
on the evolution of policing alone. Our model makes 'long term' predictions equivalent to those of optimization models, but we also show the existence of protected polymorphisms of police and
civilians, as well as competitors and non-competitors.","Brandvain, Yaniv and Wade, Michael J"

payoff for mutual cooperation, R, is greater than the payoff for mutual defection, P. But a defector versus a cooperator receives the highest payoff, T, where as the cooperator obtains the lowest
payoff, S. Hence, the Prisoner's Dilemma is defined by the payoff ranking T {\textgreater} R {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} S. In a well-mixed population, defectors always have a higher expected
payoff than cooperators, and therefore natural selection favors defectors. The evolution of cooperation requires specific mechanisms. Here we discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation:
direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, kin selection, group selection, and network reciprocity (or graph selection). Each mechanism leads to a transformation of the Prisoner's Dilemma payoff
matrix. From the transformed matrices, we derive the fundamental conditions for the evolution of cooperation. The transformed matrices can be used in standard frameworks of evolutionary dynamics such
as the replicator equation or stochastic processes of game dynamics in finite populations.","Taylor, Christine and Nowak, Martin A."

influence species change. The idea that sociality, not just biology, was important in determining evolutionary outcomes was prevalent in research in social ecology in the 1920s and 1930s. The
influence of ‘tradition’ (or the transmission of learned behaviours between generations) and the view that animals are active in selecting their own environments, rather than passive organisms acted
upon by chance, were given as much attention as natural selection theory in European ecology, while animal aggregation and cooperation studies were pursued in America. Imanishi Kinji’s personal
library and his scientific notes and papers reveal that he was well aware of this literature and had been profoundly influenced by these earlier viewpoints prior to writing his view of nature in his
first book, Seibutsu no Sekai (The World of Living Things, 1941). Evidence is presented to show that he developed his theories based partly on early western debates in social ecology while finding
inspiration and a way to express his views in the writings of philosopher Nishida Kitarō and, perhaps, General J C Smuts. One of Imanishi’s lasting contributions is in the demonstrated results of over
40 years of subsequent ecological and ethological research by Imanishi and those trained by him that maintained the broader viewpoints on evolution that had been dropped from the western corpus of
research by the 1950s. The current attempt to again get beyond natural selection theory is reflected in debates surrounding genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation, the biology of ‘traditions’

can produce populations capable of electing a leader and, when that leader is terminated, electing a new leader. This result serves as an existence proof that group selection and digital evolution can
produce complex cooperative behaviors, and therefore have promise in the design of robust distributed computing systems.","Knoester, David B. and McKinley, Philip K. and Ofria, Charles A."

that shapes extreme traits. People prefer partners who display valuable resources and bestow them selectively on close partners. The resulting phenotypic covariance between displays and preferences
gives fitness advantages to both, creating runaway selection that could shape a whole suite of prosocial traits including altruism, moral capacities, empathy, and theory of mind. Even though they give
a net fitness benefit, traits at the endpoint of runaway social selection can have substantial deleterious effects on other traits such as viability, ability to accumulate resources, or vulnerability
to mental disorders. Social selection forces arising from self-interested partner choices may be an invisible hand that shaped capacities for commitment, altruism, and other prosocial capacities of

very few studies have explicitly simulated specific cross-cultural patterns, much potential exists for future investigations. This integration of small-scale experimental simulations and largescale

practice, and Western musical history, or on music's relationships with abstract domains such as mathematics. For both strands of thought, evolution was simply irrelevant to their concerns which were
viewed as primarily musicological, focused on the explication of the historical and ontological roots of Western music. Any evolutionary approach to understanding music requires at least an
operational definition of what might constitute ‘music’. Music involves patterned action in time, as does dance. Music appears communicative, complex, generative, and representational, as does
language. The concept of music is amalgamated with that of dance in many — perhaps the majority of — cultures.","Cross, Ian"

its effects on predator-prey population dynamics and show that the presence of scrounging predators allows an increased predator population size and contributes to the regulation of both predator and
prey populations. Behavioral ecologists will appreciate that although scrounging is often pictured as imposing a social foraging cost to group membership, at the population level it also allows higher
numbers of both prey and predators to coexist at equilibrium.","Coolen, Isabelle and Giraldeau, Luc-Alain and Vickery, William"

little information available in literature on the biology of the Pied Crow. It is widespread in Mrica south of the Sahara except where there is desert or tropical forest (Mackworth-Praed and Grant,
1963). Pied Crows have received the attention of research workers mainly because of their feeding habits. Among the types of food that they are reported to eat are agricultural crops like maize, and
young domestic fowls and eggs (Priest, 1936). On occasions, Pied Crows attack lambs and peck them to death, pulling their eyes out (Hey, 1966), a habit reported about other corvids in Britain and
Australia (Holyoak, 1968; Rowley, 1969). In addition, Priest (1936) suggested that they eat insects off cattle and wild animals. The period of egg-laying seems to vary from place to place, being in
January in Uganda, western Kenya and the Sudan, and in November in eastern Kenya (Mackworth-Praed and Grant, 1963). Nests are usually constructed in the branches of lofty trees (Clancey, 1964;
Mackworth-Praed and Grant, 1963) but some nests have been found near the ground (Priest, 1936)and others on telephone poles-a rather unusual site (Clancey, 1964). This study of the crow populations in

Part of the problem is a reluctance to revisit the pivotal events that took place
during the 1960s, including the rejection of group selection and the development of alternative theoretical frameworks to explain the evolution of cooperative and altruistic behaviors. In this
article, we take a “back to basics” approach, explaining what group selection is, why its rejection was regarded as so important, and how it has been revived based on a more careful formulation and
subsequent research. Multilevel selection theory (including group selection) provides an elegant theoretical foundation for sociobiology in the future, once its turbulent past is appropriately
understood. D perceived a fundamental problem of social life and its potential solution in the following famous passage from Descent of Man (1871:166): It must not be forgotten that although a high
standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children over the other men 328 Volume 82 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of the same tribe . . . an increase in
the number of well-endowed men and an advancement in the standard of morality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another. The problem is that for a social group to function as
an adaptive unit, its members must do things for each other. Yet, these group-advantageous behaviors seldom maximize relative fitness within the social group. The solution, according to Darwin, is
that natural selection takes place at more than one level of the biological hierarchy. Selfish individuals might out-compete altruists within groups, but internally altruistic groups out-compete
selfish groups. This is the essential logic of what has become known as multilevel selection theory. Darwin’s insight would seem to provide an elegant theoretical foundation for sociobiology, but that
is not what happened, as anyone familiar with the subject knows. Instead, group selection was widely rejected in the 1960s and other theoretical frameworks were developed to explain the evolution of
altruism and cooperation in more individualistic terms. The following passage from George C Williams’s book, Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966:92–93), illustrates the tenor of the times, which
seemed to make the rejection of group selection a pivotal event in the history of evolutionary thought: It is universally conceded by those who have seriously concerned themselves with this problem .
. . that such grouprelated adaptations must be attributed to the natural selection of alternative groups of individuals and that the natural selection of alternative alleles within populations will be
opposed to this development. I am in entire agreement with the reasoning behind this conclusion. Only by a theory of between-group selection could we achieve a scientific explanation of group-related
adaptations. However, I would question one of the premises on which the reasoning is based. Chapters 5 to 8 will be primarily a defense of the thesis that group-related adaptations do not, in fact,
exist. A group in this discussion should be understood to mean something other than a family and to be composed of individuals that need not be closely related. Forty years later, this clarity has
been lost. In the current sociobiological literature, it is easy to find the following contradictory positions, side by side in the same journals and bookshelves: • Nothing has changed since the
1960s. • Multilevel selection theory (including group selection) has been fully revived. • There is a “new” multilevel selection theory that bears little relationship to the “old” theory. • Group
selection is not mentioned, as if it never existed in the history of evolutionary thought. Part of this confusion can be explained in terms of the diffusion of knowledge. It takes time for the newest
developments in theoretical biology to reach scientists who conduct empirical research, and longer still to reach diverse audiences who receive their information third, fourth, and fifth hand.
However, part of the confusion continues to exist at the highest level of scientific discourse, as we will show. We think that sociobiology’s theoretical foundation can be as clear today as it
appeared to be in the 1960s, but only if we go back to the beginning and review the basic logic of multilevel selection, what appeared to be at stake in the 1960s, and why the original rejection of
group selection must be reevaluated on the basis of subsequent research. Everyone can benefit from this “back to basics” approach, from the most advanced theorists to students learning about
sociobiology for the first time. A Word About Tainted Words It is a natural human tendency to avoid associating oneself with people or ideas that have acquired a bad reputation in the past. Thus,
there are evolutionists who study social behavior, but avoid the term “sociobiology,” or who study psychology, but avoid the term “evolutionary psychology,” because of particular ideas that were
associated with these terms in the past, including their supposed December 2007 329 THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF SOCIOBIOLOGY political implications. At a broader scale, there are people who avoid the
word “evolution” because of past negative associations, even though they are clearly talking about evolutionary processes. We think that this very understandable temptation needs to be resisted in the
case of scientific terminology, because the short-term gain for the user (avoiding negative associations) results in long-term confusion for the field as a whole (a proliferation of terms that mean
the same thing). The problem has been especially severe for multilevel selection theory because many evolutionists have felt that their very careers would be jeopardized if they invoked group
selection. In some cases, their fears were well founded; we could provide numerous examples of colleagues whose articles and grant proposals were rejected when stated in terms of multilevel selection
theory, and then accepted when restated using other terms. In this article, we define our terms at face value, regardless of past associations: sociobiology is the study of social behavior from a
biological perspective, group selection is the evolution of traits based on the differential survival and reproduction of groups, and so on. Returning to face-value definitions is a first step toward
resolving the confusion that plagues the modern sociobiological literature (see also Foster et al. 2007). From an evolutionary perspective, a behavior can be regarded as social whenever it influences
the fitness of other individuals in addition to the actor. Social behaviors need not be prosocial; aggression fits the definition as does cooperation. Also, the interactions need not be direct; a
feeding behavior that reduces the fitness of others by depleting their resources counts as social. Even genetic and developmental interactions within a single individual can be regarded as social,
since the organisms of today are now known to be the social groups of past ages, as we will describe in more detail below. Narrower definitions of social behavior might be useful for some purposes,
but the important point to keep in mind is that the concepts reviewed in this article apply to any trait that influences the fitness of others in addition to the actor, regardless of how “social”
these traits might appear in the intuitive sense. The History and Basic Logic of Multilevel Selection Theory During evolution by natural selection, a heritable trait that increases the fitness of
others in a group (or the group at a whole) at the expense of the individual possessing the trait will decline in frequency within the group. This is the fundamental problem that Darwin identified for
traits associated with human morality, and it applies with equal force to group-advantageous traits in other species. It is simply a fact of social life that individuals must do things for each other
to function successfully as a group, and that these actions usually do not maximize their relative fitness within the group. Why is there usually a tradeoff? Because there is usually a tradeoff
between all adaptations. Antipredator adaptations usually interfere with harvesting food, adaptations for moving through one medium (such as the air) usually interfere with moving through another
medium (such as the water), and so on. The same principle applies to adaptations for functioning as a team player in a well-coordinated group, compared to maximizing one’s relative fitness within the
group. This does not mean that the tradeoff must necessarily be severe. Benefiting others or one’s group as a whole does not invariably require extreme self-sacrifice, such as rushing into a burning
house to save a child, but it does require some set of coordinating mechanisms, such as organizing and paying for a fire department, passing and enforcing fire safety legislation, and so on. It is
unlikely that these coordination mechanisms evolve as a coincidental byproduct of organisms that are adapted exclusively to survive and reproduce better than other members of their same group. That is
why Darwin felt confident in saying that “a high standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children over the other men of the same tribe.” As for human
morality, so also for group-level adaptations in all species. Something more than natural selection within single groups is required to explain how altruism and other group-advantageous traits evolve
by natural selection. For Darwin, in the passage quoted above, that “some330 Volume 82 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY thing” was between-group selection. Groupadvantageous traits do increase the
fitness of groups, relative to other groups, even if they are selectively neutral or disadvantageous within groups. Total evo","Wilson, D. and Wilson, E."

from analytical and numerical simulations utilizing a simple three-species food chain model suggest that while the addition of prey MIF to the model provides a stabilizing influence, as the chaotic
dynamics collapse to a stable steady state, adding only predator MIF to the model can only stabilize the system at intermediate MIF values. The three-species trophic food chain is also stabilized when
combination of both prey and predator MIF is added to the model. Our work serves to provide insight into the effects of MIF in the real world.","Zhang, Fengpan and Li, Zi‐zhen and Zhang, Xinfeng and Gao, Meng"

Procellariiformes), using analyses that statistically controlled for variations in body size and phylogeny. Incubation and fledging periods appeared strongly correlated, but this turned out to be
largely explained by phylogeny. Nonetheless, developmental and reproductive rates were associated with the distance to the foraging range, as predicted under the hypothesis of ecological constraints
on breeding pairs, and these results were independent of body size and phylogeny. Slower breeding in these seabirds appeared associated with the rigors of farther pelagic feeding, as Lack originally
hypothesized.","Dobson, F. Stephen and Jouventin, Pierre"

behavior. Besides confirming the main expectations, the results point to the need for a natural ordering in grooming partner selection. This ordering can be obtained not only through kin-based groups

for the survival of this species, supported by wide ethological evidence. By means of simulation, we study the performance of the system under varying mutation rate (giving rise to cheaters that
exploit the altruistic mechanism) and roost size. Results show that the roosting effect can cope with sensible mutation levels. Moreover, the most robust size of roosts indicated by our simulations is

Mindful of the explosion of evolutionary rhetoric in the socio-economic domain over
the last three decades and informed by the modern generalized Darwinian perspective, the research has been focused on the evaluation of the precise nature and extent of use of Darwinian ideas in three
of the most influential evolutionary accounts in these disciplines. Notably, Nelson and Winter’s Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change (1982), Hannan and Freeman’s Organizational Ecology (1989), and
Howard Aldrich’s Organizations Evolving (1999). It is a work of comparative theory. Also since 1980, theoretical and conceptual advances in evolutionary theory confirmed the generic nature of
Darwinian theory and provided generalized terms for its articulation. Whilst some major criticisms of Darwinism are easily dismissed, significantly scholars have shown that Lamarckian acquired
character inheritance must be accommodated within the meta-theoretical framework of Darwinism. This study shows that whilst the damaging rhetoric of ‘Social Darwinism’ continues to discourage
widespread active engagement with Darwinian theory, the pervasive implicit or ‘covert’ adoption of Darwinian ideas by social scientists nevertheless clearly endorses its general nature, confirms a
Darwinian social ontology and underlines the inevitability of Darwinism in the socio-cultural domain. Following a detailed exposition of general Darwinism, this study presents a forensic comparative
evaluation of the evolutionary theories under study, highlighting theoretical gaps and inconsistencies, and demonstrating their resolution within the Darwinian framework. Through the systematic
application and dissection of these disparate theories, one of which is labelled ‘Lamarckian’, the analysis shows the deep extent to which they all are Darwinian. And furthermore, underlining the
promise of the Darwinian system for yielding further results, the study clearly illustrates the importance of the explicit adoption of modern Darwinian concepts for helping scholars to understand the
complex evolutionary processes they seek to explain","Dollimore, Denise E."

Our study used an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach, blending
avian and plant ecology, ecohydraulic, statistical ecology and modelling to evaluate potential impacts of water level fluctuations on indicator species representative of the wetland breeding bird
assemblages in the entire LOSL freshwater system. Multi-year (2000–2003) bird surveys captured bird distribution and density in wetland habitats under varying degrees of water inandation, depth and
fluctuation. Analyses revealed strong associations between estimated breeding pair densities and plant communities, water depth, and degree of water level fluctuation during the breeding season for a
suite of wetland bird species using marsh, wet meadow, shrub swamp and treed swamp habitats. These quantitative associations were used to develop wetland bird performance indicators for use in a LOSL
water regulation review study. Several bird species also nest at or near the water surface and are thus vulnerable to nest flooding or stranding. Changes to the seasonal hydrology of Lake Ontario and
St. Lawrence River that result in an increased frequency or magnitude of these nest failure events may have a significant impact on regional population sustainability. Long term nest record databases
were analyzed to create nesting flooding and stranding probability equations based on water level increases and decreases during the breeding season. These species-specific nesting relationships were
incorporated into a reproduction index.Many breeding bird species were strongly associated with specific wetland plant communities. Predicted habitat suitability, as measured by estimated breeding
pair density, can also change significantly within a specific wetland plant community based solely on changes in water depth during the breeding season. Three indicator species, Black Tern, Least
Bittern and Virginia Rail were selected as key environmental performance indicators for alternate regulation plan comparisons.Water regulation criteria should be such that the long term diversity and
abundance of wetland plant communities and frequency of spring flooding in marsh habitats during breeding are not reduced. Magnitude and frequency of water level change during the nesting season
(May–July) can also adversely impact reproductive success of many wetland bird species. As such, regulation criteria that increase the seasonal magnitude and frequency of water level change may be
detrimental to the long term viability of certain regional breeding bird populations.","Desgranges, Jean-Luc and Ingram, Joel and Drolet, Bruno and Morin, Jean and Savage, Caroline and Borcard, Daniel"

The essence of SIT is that human social bonds evolved as overarching, emotion regulating mechanisms

dynamic memory complex, with cognitive, affective, and neurohormonal features. When activated, this complex works to minimize self versus other motivational conflicts associated with altruistic
decision making. Our proposal that social bonds evolved because they promoted giving away (as opposed to getting) valuable resources represents a departure from traditional wisdom, and has important
implications for interpreting and investigating close relationship phenomena.","Brown, Stephanie L. and Brown, R. Michael"

The
pushing contests occurred near patches ofEnteromorpha sp., their favorite algal food resource. Three or four dominance ranks were determined from the consequences of the contests in different seasons.
Individuals in lower dominance ranks tended to shift their resting sites significantly more than those in higher ranks. The dominance order of limpets is considered to play an important role in
migration by its effect on resting site fidelity. Density dependent dispersal, from the lower to the upper part of limpets' habitats, was observed in late summer to winter when desiccation was not a
problem and food resources became abundant in less populated areas. In late spring to summer, however, migration was directed downwards, from less to more populated areas, where desiccation pressure
was relatively weaker. This migration is considered to have a survival advantage, and the behavior of the limpets may have masked density-dependent dispersal during the two seasons. Distribution of
home site was also considered affected by aggressive social behavior during the two periods.","Iwasaki, Keiji"

was added than on the control grid. Reproductive output was more closely associated with the difference in density between grids than survival or dispersal (immigration and emigration) rates. (2) The
number of adult females and pregnancy rate of the experimental population were significantly greater than those of the control one. The difference in the number of adult females between the
populations was greater than that in pregnancy rate. (3) The proportion of successful litters and the number of weanlings per litter were not significantly different between the control and

overlapped more on the experimental grid than on the control grid. (5) Mean territory size of adult females on the experimental grid was about half of that on the control grid. The territory size was
correlated negatively with population density. (6) The proportion of trap sites that were used by adult females was significantly greater on the experimental grid than on the control grid. This
suggests that adult females on the experimental grid used the area more extensively. This factor, in association with territory size and overlapping of territory, was also important in causing the

75,de_bernardi_cladocera_1987,Cladocera: {Predators} and prey,1987-01-01,"Among the freshwater zooplankton community, Cladocera represent one of the most common elements of pelagic populations. Being almost exclusively filter feeders and algae users and, at the same time,
the favourite prey of invertebrate and vertebrate predators, Cladocera represent the most important group in the plankton community of lakes as regards energy transfer along the food chain. Because of
their short generation times and their high reproductive efficiency, predation by invertebrates, usually, has only a limited role in controlling their density. However, at high densities, invertebrate
predators can provide an effective control of Cladocera populations. The intensive research on selective predation by vertebrates has demonstrated that this activity can be responsible, together with
competitive interactions, for the dominance of different groups in the planktonic community: large Cladocera dominate when predation is low, Rotifera and small Crustacea dominate at high predation
levels and high nannoplanktonic densities. These evidences on the role of vertebrate predation in structuring aquatic environments has greatly contributed to our better understanding of aquatic
ecosystem functioning. In particular, it seems that the removal of large filter-feeding herbivorous Cladocera by zooplanktivorous fish can lead to worsening environmental conditions in eutrophicating
lakes. In this respect, Cladocera appear to be the key group among zooplanktonic organisms, and their interactions the key factors in aquatic food chain management.","de Bernardi, R. and Giussani, G. and Manca, M."

may create intense intraspecific competition for group membership which, it is hypothesized, has resulted in this rare pattern of hierarchical relations. It is shown that individual-level selection is
sufficient to explain the evolution of this apparently “altruistic” status system, though other mechanisms are assessed. The energetic constraints imposed by a folivorous diet appear to restrict the
expression of aggression to “ritualized” forms. Two groups of monkeys in two different habitats were studied and the rates of appeasement and aggressive behavior were found to be higher in the more

Columbia (IWAO and WELLINGTON, 1970; WELLINGTON, 1957, 1964, 1965a). The study was originally designed to measure any effects of individual differences in behavior on population dynamics (WELLINGTON,
1960). However, the techniques employed provided a reliable means of distinguishing individuals within a generation which varied in their ability to survive or to reproduce. In addition, the work was
done within a mosaic of different local climates which changed in suitability as the overall climate changed annually. Thus it was also possible to examine the interactions of population quality and
varying climate. Furthermore, the insects were exceptionally easy to locate during their larval stage, as whole families remained together in conspicuous silk tents. The total population on the
peninsula therefore was as easy to find when colonies were very scarce as when they were plentiful. Because of that combination of circumstances, the study provided unique data on the spatial,
temporal, numerical and qualitative changes in an insect population as it increased and decreased in its natural setting. The field work spanned the period when ecologists were beginning to consider

and water, do not increase indefinitely, but growth is controlled as a result of factors thought to develop intrinsically to each population (BROWN 1953; CALHOUN 1950, 1952, 1962; CHITTY 1960;
CHRISTIAN 1964 ; NICHOLSON 1957 ; SOUTHWICK 1955 ; TERMAN 1965, 1969). Increases in the density of such populations have been correlated with a number of changes within the populations. Among these
are behavioral changes involving patterns of activity, increases in aggressive behavior, disturbance of maternal care, modifications of spatial distribution and alteration in the population social
structure (CALHOUN 1950, 1962; STRECKER and EMLEN 1953; SOUTHWICK 1955; LLOYD and CHRISTIAN 1969). In addition, physiological changes have been shown to occur which increase mortality, decrease
growth, and reduce reproductive function (see THIESSEN and RODGERS 1961, and CHRISTIAN et al., 1965, for reviews). While it is recognized that some of these changes may be species specific, others may
be related to general mechanism of population control. Recent laboratory studies of Prairie deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) have shown that populations of these mice also controlled their
numbers in the presence of surplus food and water (TERMAN 1965). Males born into these populations exhibited significantly lighter testes and vesicular gland weights than bisexually paired controls of
similar age. The development of the reproductive organs of females (ovaries and uteri) were also inhibited and were significantly lighter than those of controls. A further indication of the strength
of the inhibitory forces in the populations is the fact that 95\% of the females born into the populations failed to reproduce (TERMAN 1969). The experimental data obtained from these Peromyscus
populations left unanswered the question of whether the significantly lighter weights of the reproductive organs of population males and females when compared to controls was due to inhibition of

26,connell_territorial_1963,Territorial behavior and dispersion in some marine invertebrates,1963-01-01,"One of the important characteristics of any population of living organisms is the dispersion, or spatial pattern of the individuals. Many analyses of dispersion have been made, principally in plants ;
few populations have been found to be random (see Greig-Smith, 1957, for a review). Non-random dispersion implies the operation of some kind of constraint upon the distribution. Since experimental
evidence is usually lacking, the nature of the constraint is generally inferred from the pattern itself. Clumping is thought to be the result either of gregarious behavior, reproductive habits (such
as seeds falling close to the parent plant), or heterogeneity of the environment such that individuals are clumped in the favorable parts of the habitat. Uniform dispersion is generally ascribed to
some type of negative interaction between the individuals. In the analysis of dispersion, the positions of the individuals are taken to be dimensionless points. If, however, there is a relatively
great range in the sizes of the individuals or in the areas under their influence, even intense negative interaction between them may not produce a uniform pattern. PIELOU (1960) showed that absolute
competition for space could produce uniform, random or aggregated distributions as the range in size of the ""territories"" of the individuals was increased. When the range in size was great, the few
very large individuals occupied most of the area, while the smaller ones were clumped in between, both in artificial populations and in natural stands of trees. Thus the inferences usually drawn as to
the constraining mechanisms, although logical, may be completely wrong under these conditions. Since variation in size is the rule in living organisms, analyses based upon positions alone may lead to
erroneous conclusions. This is probably one of the reasons for the infrequent occurrence of uniform patterns in nature (GREI6-SMITH, 1957). As a consequence, the frequency of occurrence of competition
under natural conditions will be underestimated. It is obvious that observations of both the behavior and size of organisms must be made in conjunction with analyses of dispersion before the causes of
the pattern can be revealed. Such observations are, evidently, rare. One such study is that of","Connell, Joseph H."

show that in many cases, 20\%40\% of individuals will free ride regardless of the frequency and severity of punishment. This treatise seeksto explain the persistence of free riders by arguing that

Whenever evolution constructs something entirely new (such as multi-cellularity or human language), cooperation is needed. Evolutionary construction is based on cooperation. I will present five basic
principles for the evolution of cooperation, which arise in the theories of kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, graph selection and group selection.",

systems; the emergence of life on earth was inevitably accompanied by the appearance of the first nutrient cycles; besides species evolution, there exists one more quite independent evolutionary
lineage – the evolution of ecosystems which proceeds through individual selection, its direction being predetermined by an ecological community. This system of views was termed the Russian paradigm by

They are surrounded by ice for most of each year. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) cross
the sea ice in seasonal migrations among the islands and between the mainland and Arctic Islands. We compiled observations of 1272 discrete caribou crossings on the sea ice of northeastern Franklin
Strait, Bellot Strait, Peel Sound and Baring Channel in the south-central Canadian Arctic Archipelago during four May—June search periods from 1977 to 1980. We clustered the 850 caribou trails found
on the sea ice of northeastern Franklin Strait and on outer Peel Sound as 73 sea-ice crossing sites. We investigated whether caribou at the origin of a sea-ice crossing site could see land on the
opposite side at the potential terminus. We measured the straight-line distance from where the caribou first came onto the ice (origin) to the first possible landfall (potential terminus). Potential
termini were geodetically visible to caribou from elevated terrain near 96\% of the origins of the 73 sea-ice crossing sites and still visible at sea-level at the origins on 68\%. Caribou are able to
take advantage of seasonal use of all of the islands and the peninsula by making sea-ice crossings, thereby helping to increase the magnitudes and durations of population highs and reduce their lows.
Knowledge of these alternative pat¬terns of use made possible by sea-ice crossings is necessary to fully understand the population dynamics of these caribou and the importance of possible future
changes in ice cover.","Miller, Frank L. and Barry, Samuel J. and Calvert, Wndy A."

35,caldwell_family_2006,Family {Size} {Control} by {Infanticide} in the {Great} {Agrarian} {Societies} of {Asia},2006-01-01,"INTRODUCTIONAn important issue in demography is whether there is evidence for premodern population control, especially control of family size. In an earlier paper we have argued that there is
insufficient evidence to conclude that Palaeolithic society consciously practised population control; its approximate long-term population equilibrium is probably adequately explained by non-
infanticidal mortality balancing fertility (Caldwell and Caldwell, 2003a). Certainly babies were often killed when deformed or in times of crisis but not on a scale to constitute a demographically
significant impact.This was not necessarily the case in the preindustrial agrarian societies of Asia where we have copious references to infanticide in governmental, legal, religious and literary
texts (House of Commons, 1824;HanleyandYamamura, 1977:233;Ho, 1959:58). Some demographers have identified a parallel between preindustrial Western European societies, where deferred or forgone
marriage allowed a balance of fertility and mortality at moderate levels, and the situation in Japan, China and probably Korea where supposedly massive infanticide lowered the effective level of
reproduction ensuring reduced death rates for those older than infancy, and less population pressure on the environment (Macfarlane, 1976:309ff; Wrigley, 1978:135136; Das Gupta, 1995:486ff). Wrigley
argued that this could be the result of ""unconscious rationality"" which particularly characterized the period immediately before industrialization (called by others ""proto-industrialization"" and
roughly describing the situation in East Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). We aim to explore recent research to see if it supports these descriptions. But first we must document
why the West reacted so strongly to Asian infanticide and was so keen to detect and record its existence.The reasons that infanticide was likely to be practised were that it did not endanger the
mother's life as did premodern abortion, it allowed selection for sex unlike contraception and premodern abortion, it was effective unlike premodern contraception, and its performance required neither
special skills nor esoteric knowledge (see Skinner, 1993:251). These were not arguments in favour in Europe, nor those now increasingly accepted by officialdom anywhere in the world, a situation
explained by colonization, social and economic globalization, and the domination of contemporary international agencies by Western ethics. This is an area perhaps best explained by the unusual
evolution of the West. There is a parallel here with the proposition, encountered later in this paper and put forward by Cornell (1984:338), that there is no need to explain the absence of spinsters
in historic Japan, but, on the contrary, any explanation must be in terms of the peculiar Western situation where spinsters were common. This is an analysis of Western attitudes rather than practices,
although it seems that the West practised abandonment much more often than direct infanticide (Boswell, 1988:44-45.)The peculiar attitude to infanticide of the West, or rather of the People of the
Book - Jews, Christians and Muslims - lies in their common religious evolution, its origin being in Judaism. That the Jews did not always abhor infanticide is brought out by the need felt by their
prophets to oppose it. They ""bitterly denounced the heathenish Israelite practice of child sacrifice [and] therefore opposed a religious custom which was in strict accordance with the deeply ingrained
social tenets of all the powerful and ancient civilizations -surrounding the lands of Israel and Judah"" (Patai, 1959:129-130). The condemnation of infanticide was solidified by the Jewish thinkers of
the diaspora, especially in Alexandria where Philo early in the first century A.D. opposed it, together with abortion and exposure, on two grounds, first that it was murder and second that it showed
that sexual intercourse had taken place solely for pleasure (Noonan, 1970:6). …","Caldwell, Bruce K."

developments in the current literature on the emergence of norms.","Andreozzi, Luciano"

The typical movement pattern included many
short distance moves with rare long distance movements. These skewed distributions made the mean a poor descriptor of movement and this is likely a common issue in other studies. Sexes had similar
movement patterns and moved less frequently and shorter distances per day during cooler seasons. Rare long-distance movements occurred primarily in the spring. Propensity to move and mean distance
moved per day varied across sites. Home-range size increased with additional fixes even after four years and had a seasonal pattern, increasing during warmer seasons and remaining stable or shrinking
during cooler seasons. Despite using novel habitat in sequential years, nearly all individuals used the same general area over longer periods of time. Finally, individuals of both sexes had high
levels of spatial overlap. The results indicate for L. roseofusca (1) Individual variability in movement is more the rule than the exception; (2) Common seasonal patterns in movement and space use do
exist; (3) Home-range sizes vary through time yet remain in the same general location; and (4) A lack of territoriality and considerable overlap in space use exist.","Diffendorfer, James E. and Rochester, Carlton and Fisher, Robert N. and Brown, Tracey K."

Thus, in both young individuals and small species, the middle ear is expected to be allometrically enlarged
despite its smaller absolute size. Here we aim to compare the ontogenetic allometry of relevant middle-ear structures as observed within gecko (gekkonomorph lizards) species, with the evolutionary
allometry observed interspecifically. These observations also provide middle-ear data for future evaluation of variation in auditory sensitivity. The material comprised 84 museum specimens of geckos,
representing nine species of three gekkonomorph subfamilies. The results of dissections and measurements show that different reports notwithstanding, the middle-ear ossicular chain is indeed
structured as described for geckos by Werner and Wever. Some sexual dimorphism is indicated, but this requires further study. During postnatal ontogeny, the allometric growth in the ratio of the
columellar footplate area to body length differed between the intraspecific and interspecific levels, hence species differences in the middle ear do not merely result from animal size. The ratio of
the tympanic membrane area to the columellar footplate area increased during ontogeny. In this, geckos resemble birds and probably also mammals. Similarly, when the comparison was among adults
representing different species, the ratio of the tympanic membrane area to the columellar footplate area increased with body size. In this, however, the geckos differed from birds and mammals, in
which this ratio varied taxonomically, irrespective of body size. It would thus seem that middle-ear proportions have evolved among geckos to produce small interspecific differences, but among amniote
tetrapods they have evolved according to different principles in the classes reptiles, birds, and mammals.","Werner, Yehudah L. and Safford, Shawn D. and Seifan, Merav and Saunders, James C."

Here we explore how and why Gould's ideas on concepts related to species selection evolved over 30 years, from the punctuated equilibria paper of 1972 to his “Structure of Evolutionary Theory” magnum
opus published in 2002. Throughout his career his ideas on species selection shifted between three phases. Initially, Gould favored a definition of species selection that was more descriptive. Later,
he came to distinguish between species sorting, which he called species selection in the broad sense, and true species selection, which is tied to the concept of species-level aptations. Finally, he
came to view species selection in a broader, more inclusive way, effectively merging the two earlier viewpoints. His ideas on species selection changed over the years because he was trying to square
his views on complex concepts like adaptation, natural selection, emergence, and the independence of macroevolutionary theory. Gould's thoughts on species selection not only help to define the history
of debate on the concept but also help set a course for the future.","Lieberman, Bruce S. and Vrba, Elisabeth S."

new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did
not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of “saltatory equilibria”
results from the lions' grouping behavior.","Packer, Craig and Hilborn, Ray and Mosser, Anna and Kissui, Bernard and Borner, Markus and Hopcraft, Grant and Wilmshurst, John and Mduma, Simon and Sinclair, Anthony R. E."

25,mock_peak_1990,The peak load reduction hypothesis for avian hatching asynchrony,1990-01-01,"SummaryAccording to the Peak Load Reduction Hypothesis, avian parents establish within-brood hatching asynchrony (via early incubation of first-laid eggs) in order to lower the maximum level of the
brood's daily food demands. By offsetting the individual demand curves by a day or more, parents may be able to achieve adaptive levels of effort relief. We examined the potential parental savings
from this strategy by developing a simple analytical model wherein individual offspring demand curves were either aligned (as in synchronous hatching) or displaced by a hatching interval variable
(asynchronous hatching). Parental savings were calculated for various common brood sizes and hatching intervals.The results show that substantial savings can accrue to parents if both broods and
hatching intervals are large or if individual demand curves rise to a high, narrow peak. However, the parameter values necessary for load reductions of even 5\% appear seldom, if ever, met in nature.
Unless very small savings have disproportionate value to parents, it seems unlikely that hatching asynchrony evolved because of its direct effects on trimming parental effort. The possibility remains
open that adaptive levels of parental savings could result from a secondary interaction between a modest initial hatching interval and consequent competition among nestlings, which can greatly amplify
the chicks' growth rate differences.","Mock, Douglas W. and Schwagmeyer, P. L."

roosted communally in winter. Strong winds reduced the height of roost perches, and roosting in leeward conditions increased. Less time was spent at the roost before and following roosting in winter
when compared with the autumn and the spring situations. Magpies from high quality territories arrived late in the evening and left early in the morning. Foraging activity increased at the roost as
day-length decreased, whereas flying remained constant. Sexual and aggressive behaviour were common in spring. Juveniles were sub-ordinate at the roost. Communal gathering was common at the roost.
Several activities occurred frequently either at the pre-roost or at the roost, but aggressive and sexual behaviour had a spatial distribution as expected from the number of birdhours spent in the two
sites. Roosting ceased following initiation of nesting activity, but early nesters attended the roost longer than late nesters following start of nest building. Start of breeding was not synchronized
within roosts. Predation was rare at the roost and elsewhere in the study area. Roosting seems not to be due to information centre effects, predator avoidance, favourable micro-climate, lack of roost
sites, or synchronization of breeding activities. Magpies may monitor the quality of their neighbours including their mating status at the roost. Communal roosting of corvid species seems to be
related primarily to the distribution and the abundance of food, species with an unpredictable food supply roosting communally. Warum ziehen Elstern Gemeinschaftsschlafplätze der Einzelübernachtung
vor? Viele Übernachtungsplätze liegen in Laubbäumen am Wasser und werden meist nur von relativ wenigen Individuen benutzt. Im Winter übernachteten jedoch alle Elstern in größeren Scharen (Abb. 1).
Starker Wind verringert die Höhe der Sitzplätze und begünstigt leewärts gelegene. Vor und nach dem Übernachten waren die Elstern im Winter weniger lange Zeit answesend als im Frühjahr und Herbst (Abb.
6). Elstern aus Revieren hoher Qualität kamen abends später und flogen morgens früher wieder ab (Abb. 7, 8). Nahrungssuche am Übernachtungsplatz nahm mit abnehmender Tageslänge zu; Flugaktivität blieb
konstant. Im Frühjahr waren Anzeichen von Aggressivität und Sexualverhalten häufig. Juv. nahmen an Übernachtungsplätzen niedrigere Rangstellungen ein. Schwarmbildung war häufig. Verschiedene
Aktivitäten waren häufig entweder vor oder am Übernachtungsplatz festzustellen, doch Aggressiv- und Sexualverhalten konzentrieren sich meistens auf Plätze außerhalb. Nach Beginn des Nestbaus wurde der

verlief der Beginn des Nestbaus nicht synchron. Der Feinddruck am Schlafplatz wie im übrigen Untersuchungsgebiet war sehr gering. Gemeinsames Übernachten scheint keine Bedeutung als
Informationszentrum oder für Verringerung der Feindeinwirkung zu besitzen, noch ist es wegen günstigen Mikroklimas, des Fehlens geeigneter Übernachtungsplätze oder als Mittel der Synchronisation des
Brutgeschäftes erklärbar. Elstern prüfen vielleicht die Qalität ihrer Nachbarn und ob sie verpaart sind. Gemeinsames Übernachten scheint bei Corviden in erster Linie mit der Verteilung und Menge der

Schilfsamenaufbereitung angepaßt. Er wiegt zwischen 0,88 und 1,21 g und ist dicht mit Steinchen bestimmter Größe gefüllt. Das Keratinoidhäutchen bildet dicke, harte Reibplatten. Im Sommer ist der
Magen kleiner (0,50–0,68 g) und enthält keine oder nur wenige, unterschiedlich große Steinchen. Das Keratinoidhäutchen ist weich und wölbt sich in zwei weichen Polstern ins Magenlumen (D 5). 10. Als
Zeitgeber für die Magenumstellung im Herbst muß die abnehmende Tageslänge angenommen werden. Bei der Magenumstellung im Frühjahr dürften die Temperatur und zusätzlich vielleicht die Ernährung als
Zeitgeber wirksam sein. Nach der herbstlichen Magenumstellung verhindert bis Anfang Dezember eine Refraktärperiode eine vorzeitige Umstellung zur Sommerform (F 8). 11. Bartmeisen sind nicht durch
kalte, lange Winter, sondern durch warme Winter mit späten Kälteeinbrüchen gefährdet, da dann die Vögel nach erfolgter Magenumstellung zur Sommerform nicht mehr in der Lage sind, Schilfsamen
aufzubereiten und so infolge fehlenden Insektenangebotes verhungern (G). 1. Bearded Tits are to be considered invasion or eruption birds. The “Höhenflug“-behaviour expresses a pressure factor which,
upon reaching a certain threshold, causes the wandering off of part of the population (C 1). 2. The breeding season begins in the last third of March and lasts till mid August. Up to 4 successive
broods may be raised. Autumn broods (egg-laying at end of August/beginning of September) by possibly first year moulted juvenile birds may occur (C 3). 3. Bearded Tits don't seem to have a juvenile
refractory period. Maturing of the gonades in birds, which are fully moulted at the beginning of September, is inhibited by decreasing day-length. 4. Maturing of the gonades commences in both sexes at
the beginning of February (Daylength about 9 h; D 3). The start of breeding is regulated by a temperature or availability of food (F 7, 8). 5. Both sexes show an increased body-weight after moulting
(D 1; unmoulted juvenile birds average 13,96 g; winter ♂ average 16,92 g; ♀ average 15,26 g). At the beginning of the breeding season especially males show a clear decrease in weight (♂ average 14,76
g; ♀ average 14,79 g). 6. Before moulting juvenile birds may build up a dirty-yellow glassy-looking fat, which disappears after moulting. From October to the end of March all birds show much dark,
yolk-yellow subcutaneous fat (D 2). 7. The moult begins at the end of July/beginning of August with the first birds terminating the full moult at the beginning of September; tragglers finish in mid
October. At the beginning of the breeding season the down and the contour-feathers of the lateral tract are shed (D 4). The swift progress of the moult (42–50 days) is furthered by the time pressure
caused by „Höhenflug”-behaviour and stomach conversion (F 2, 3). 8. During the summer-months Bearded Tits are insectivorous, in winter granivorous (Phragmites-seeds). The change occurs in September
and February/March (E). 9. During the winter months the muscular stomach is specially adapted to digestion ofPhragmites-seeds. The stomach weights range from 0,88 g to 1,21 g; the stomachs ar filled
with small stones of certain size. The ceratinoid skin builds thick hard plates. In summer the stomach is smaller (0,50 g–0,68 g) and does not contain stones; only some times a few of differing size
can be found. The ceratinoid skin is soft and forms two pads in the stomach lumen (D 5). 10. The decreasing day-length is to be considered the releasing factor of stomach conversion in autumn. In
spring, temperature and food availability may be releasers. After the autumnal stomach conversion a refractory period prevents a premature conversion to the summer form till the beginning of December
(F 8). 11. Cold long winters do not endanger Bearded Tits so much as warm ones with late cold periods. The birds having already converted to the summerly stomach form are no longer able to digest
thePhragmites-seeds and starve to death (G).","Spitzer, Gerhard"

To
Darwin and many of his contemporaries, group selection was a perfectly respectable concept. Indeed, it was Darwin who first proposed, in The Descent of Man (1874/1871), the then unexceptional idea
that differential group selection may have played an important role in human evolution, along with what he called ""family"" selection (now known as inclusive fitness or kin selection theory) and
individual reciprocities (now called mutualism and reciprocal altruism). Darwin's ""tripartite"" explanation of human evolution was subtle, but his view of the role played by group selection is
illuminated in this brief passage: ""All that we know about savages, or may infer from their traditions and old monuments, the history of which is quite forgotten by the present inhabitants, show that
from the remotest times successful tribes have supplanted other tribes"" (p.147).1 Herbert Spencer, one of the outstanding theorists of the 19th century, expressed a similar view in The Principles of

its biological roots. Biological adaptation has somehow created a brain that yearns for transcendent idealizations of behavior beyond our capability such as utopian ideals of altruism. We explore
whether or not evolutionary explanations of altruism show that self-sacrificial behavior is a biological adaptation, a transcendent ideal, or some combination of the two. Using adoption of non-
relatives as a model, we review existing data to determine if adoption behavior is altruism or if sociobiological explanations sufficiently show it to be egoistic. Human adoption practices are mostly
amenable to evolutionary explanations. The best one can say about most adoption practices with respect to self-sacrifice is that they exhibit pro-social behavior, not altruism. In those few cases
where adoption appears to be genetically altruistic, the behavior is most often explained as mis-directed adaptive behavior. To explain the exceptions that still exist, celibates who adopt, in this
way is a form of question begging; this behavior deserves a more nuanced description. Although most adoptions are a result of pro-social behavior at best or mis-directed adaptation at worse, we still
idealize the concept of adoption as altruism (genetic selfsacrifice), admiring the rare celibates willing to sacrifice reproductive imperatives to raise others’ children. Therefore, altruism can be
realized within a few who develop in an environment emphasizing transcendent conceptions. It appears that our ability to symbolically idealize altruism makes humans unique considering that our ability
to biologically achieve it seems highly limited. Provided we continue striving to meet the ideal, humans can foster hope and purpose rooted in an eschatological future rather than a present reality.","Brannan, D. and Gillett, C."

defense is the use of James Mark Baldwin's concepts of “organic selection”and “social heredity” to assist in revealing that the gap between biological and psychological altruism is more of a small
lacuna. Specifically, this paper argues that ontogenetic behavioral adjustments, which are crucial to individual survival and reproduction, are also crucial to species survival. In particular, it is
argued that human psychological altruism is produced and maintained by various sorts of mimicry and self-reflection in the aid of both individual and species survival. The upshot of this analysis is
that it is possible to offer an account of psychological altruism that is closelytethered to biological altruism without reducing entirely the former to thelatter.","Ananth, Mahesh"

professional competition; some may arise from underlying ideological differences; and still others are apparently semantic. A few differences remain, however, that can be resolved only by showing that
someone is wrong. All four papers are efforts to analyze the mechanisms of cultural transmission and change. This development is a logical next step in the progress toward understanding the meaning of
recent advances in evolutionary biology for the problem of culture, and in the actual analysis of culture. It is appropriate that the initial question asked by this new wave of culture theorists was:
Is culture ""adaptive"" in the new sense of that term from biology? We believe that the answer to this question has been established as affirmative in a sufficiently general sense to show that the new

external destructive factors, such as emissions of acute ecotoxicants, the ecophysiological and behavioral compensatory mechanisms are activated, which provide for restoration of the total population
size to the optimum within a short period of time. Environmental pollution with substances disturbing the reproductive function has the gravest consequences for animals. In this case, population size
may remain fairly high, and, therefore, the effect of enhanced reproduction as a response to population decline does not take place, which eventually leads to a gradual but irreversible destruction of
the population. Pathologies of reproduction should be used as a criterion for assessing the state of animals in the zones of technogenic disasters.","Shilova, S. A. and Shatunovskii, M. I."

molecules by elongation and controlled scission, (c) replication of complementary duplexes and (d) replication of DNA. The initial phase is suggested by evidence for the existence of tandem repeats in
an early population of molecules presumed to be ancestral to today's structurl RNAs. Relics of these repeats are seen in the positioning of sequence matches between transfer and ribosomal RNAs.
Conservation of the positions of the matches is indicated by persistence of a periodicity in their spacings along the molecules.Selection is viewed as a vector, with a source and a focus. The
evolutionary progression entails shifts in the source of selection, from external catalysts to the replicating molecule itself, and in its focus, from substrate to replicator, to the products of the
replicator's activity. When the source and focus of selection are the same selection becomes internalized, and replication and Darwinian evolution follow.Catalytic specificity is regarded as an
antecedent to natural selection. Shifting of the source and focus of selection and switches in evolution's ‘vehicle’, the most fundamental thing that evolves, result in profound changes in the modes
of evolution. Control provides a conceptual framwork within which entry into a Darwinian mode of evolution, and ultimately liberation from Darwinian evolution might be explained.","Bloch, David P."

experimental and observational evidence inconsistent with a narrow version of rational choice theory, through a critique of models or explanations purporting to account for prosocial behavior through
other means, and via elaboration of the mechanisms, plausibility, and intellectual history of biological group selection.","Field, Alexander J."

Von Foerster's distinction, together with his own work on the epistemology of the observer, has been enormously influential on the work of a later generation of cyberneticians. It has provided an
architecture for the discipline of cybernetics, one that, in true cybernetic spirit, provides order where previously there was variety and disorder. It has provided a foundation for the research
programme that is second‐order cybernetics. However, as von Foerster himself makes clear, the distinction he articulated was imminent right from the outset in the thinking of the early cyberneticians,
before, even, the name of their discipline had been coined. In this paper, the author gives a brief account of the developments in cybernetics that lead to von Foerster's making his distinction. As is

creates a conflict of interest between the fitness of the individual and the fitness of the group. Individuals that defect from cooperation and therefore do not pay the cost but nevertheless benefit
from the cooperative behaviour of others are called cheaters. Cooperative behaviour in the presence of cheaters constitutes altruism towards the cheaters. The aim of this review is two-fold: first, to
introduce key concepts from kin selection and group selection theory that allow us to understand how cooperative behaviour can evolve in the face of cheaters; secondly, to draw attention to the
conflicts of interest prevalent in biofilms yet largely ignored in the biofilm literature. Examples discussed comprise growth restraint in stationary phase as an instance of the Prisoner's Dilemma,
growth restraint to allow channel formation, restraint in resource consumption or economical use of resources as altruistic behaviour, population heterogeneity as insurance against environmental
changes, cooperative investment in diffusible exoenzymes, cooperation of pathogens and virulence, diffusion sensing versus quorum sensing and the inflation of signals, antibiotic resistance as

52,werfel_evolution_2004,The evolution of reproductive restraint through social communication,2004-01-01,"The evolution of altruistic behavior through group selection is generally viewed as possible in theory but unlikely in reality, because individual selection favoring selfish strategies should act more
rapidly than group selection favoring cooperation. Here we demonstrate the evolution of altruism, in the form of conditional reproductive restraint based on an explicitly social mechanism, modulated
by intrapopulation communication comprising signal and evolved response, in a spatially distributed predatory/parasitic/pathogenic model system. The predatory species consistently comes to exploit a
signal implying overcrowding, individuals constraining their reproduction in response, with a corresponding increase in equilibrium reproduction rate in the absence of signal. This signaled restraint
arises in a robust way for a range of model spatial systems; it outcompetes non-signal-based restraint and is not vulnerable to subversion by noncooperating variants. In these systems, communication
is used to evaluate population density and regulate reproduction accordingly, consistent with central ideas of Wynne-Edwards [Wynne-Edwards, V. C. (1962) Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social
Behavior (Hafner, New York)], whose claims about the evolutionary importance of group selection helped ignite decades of controversy. This quantitative simulation model shows how the key evolutionary
transition from solitary living to sociality can occur. The process described here of cooperation evolving through communication may also help to explain other major evolutionary transitions such as
intercellular communication leading to multicellular organisms.","Werfel, Justin and Bar-Yam, Yaneer"

0,wilkinson_book_2004,{BOOK} {REVIEW},2004-01-01,"Global Brain, the latest book by Howard Bloom, author of The Lucifer Principle, attempts to trace the evolution of a global information exchange through the means of group selection. The evolution of
human cultural memes is compared with genetic evolution in all of natural history. For example, the emergence of the human global brain based on the Internet and other interconnective technology is
juxtaposed with the much earlier global brain formed by oceanic bacteria based on rapid exchange of plasmids of nucleic acid. Bloom further speculates that both biological and cultural change can be
explained in a rubric of five basic elements. First, conformity enforcers create a common language and vocabulary. This may be DNA in bacteria (and all other life forms) or the emerging hegemony of
English in contemporary international business. Second, there are spontaneous diversity generators. In bacteria, this may be spontaneous mutation due to radiation or chemical signals released by
neighboring bacteria. In human social psychology, the subculture plays a crucial role in allowing alternative memes to develop. Third, inner-judges deem which bacteria or humans are pursuing a
productive path. Time, energy and resources then flow towards this individual or subculture. In a diametrically opposed process, resource shifters abandon unsuccessful life forms, to focus on the more
successful bacteria or human. Finally, intergroup tournaments are staged to determine which complex adaptive system will survive. Author Howard Bloom began life as a child prodigy. He co-designed his
own computer while still in elementary school. He had a private brainstorming session with SUNY Buffalo’s head of physics department at the age of thirteen. He graduated from NYU magna cum laude and
Phi Beta Kappa, only to spend the next twenty years attempting to explore mass consciousness outside of academia. William James (1902) inspired the techniques he used that involved direct experience
followed up with scientific surveys and correlated studies. In the last twenty years, Bloom has published art magazines, a heavy metal magazine and has worked at preventing censorship of music by
Tipper Gore and her followers. More recently, Bloom has become interested in evolution, particularly the emergence of a global mind as a result of the rapid increase in information processing

0,cartlidge_rules_2004,Rules of engagement : competitive coevolutionary dynamics in computational systems,2004-01-01,"Given that evolutionary biologists have considered coevolutionary interactions since the dawn of Darwinism, it is perhaps surprising that coevolution was largely overlooked during the formative years
of evolutionary computing. It was not until the early 1990s that Hillis' seminal work thrust coevolution into the spotlight. Upon attempting to evolve fixed-length sorting networks, a problem with a
long and competitive history, Hillis found that his standard evolutionary algorithm was producing sub-standard networks. In response, he decided to reciprocally evolve a population of testlists
against the sorting network population; thus producing a coevolutionary system. The result was impressive; coevolution not only outperformed evolution, but the best network it discovered was only one
comparison longer than the best-known solution. For the first time, a coevolutionary algorithm had been successfully applied to problem-solving.   Pre-Hillis, the shortcomings of standard evolutionary
algorithms had been understood for some time: whilst defining an adequate fitness function can be as challenging as the problem one is hoping to solve, once achieved, the accumulation of fitness-
improving mutations can push a population towards local optima that are difficult to escape. Coevolution offers a solution. By allowing the fitness of each evolving individual to vary (through
competition) with other reciprocally evolving individuals, coevolution removes the requirement of a fitness yardstick. In conjunction, the reciprocal adaptations of each individual begin to erode
local optima as soon as they appear.   However, coevolution is no panacea. As a problem-solving tool, coevolutionary algorithms suffer from some debilitating dynamics, each a result of the relative
fitness assessment of individuals. In a single-, or multi-, population competitive system, coevolution may stabilize at a suboptimal equilibrium, or mediocre stable state; analogous to the traditional
problem of local optima. Populations may become highly specialized in an unanticipated (and undesirable) manner; potentially resulting in brittle solutions that are fragile to perturbation. The system
may cycle; producing dynamics similar to the children's game rock-paper-scissors. Disengagement may occur, whereby one population out-performs another to the extent that individuals cannot be
discriminated on the basis of fitness alone; thus removing selection pressure and allowing populations to drift. Finally, coevolution's relative fitness assessment renders traditional visualization
techniques (such as the graph of fitness over time) obsolete; thus exacerbating each of the above problems.   This thesis attempts to better understand and address the problems of coevolution through
the design and analysis of simple coevolutionary models. 'Reduced virulence' - a novel technique specifically designed to tackle disengagement - is developed. Empirical results demonstrate the ability
of reduced virulence to combat disengagement both in simple and complex domains, whilst outperforming the only known competitors. Combining reduced virulence with diversity maintenance techniques is
also shown to counteract mediocre stability and over-specialization.   A critique of the CIAO plot - a visualization technique developed to detect coevolutionary cycling - highlights previously
undocumented ambiguities; experimental evidence demonstrates the need for complementary visualizations. Extending the scope of visualization, a first exploration into coevolutionary steering is
performed; a technique allowing the user to interact with a coevolutionary system during run-time. Using a simple model incorporating reduced virulence, the coevolutionary steering demonstration
highlights the future potential of such tools for both research and education.   The role of neutrality in coevolution is discussed in detail. Whilst much emphasis is placed upon neutral networks in
the evolutionary computation literature, the nature of coevolutionary neutrality is generally overlooked. Preliminary ideas for modelling coevolutionary neutrality are presented.   Finally, whilst
this thesis is primarily aimed at a computing audience, strong reference to evolutionary biology is made throughout. Exemplifying potential crossover, the CIAO plot, a tool previously unused in
biology, is applied to a simulation of E. Coli, with results con rming empirical observations of real bacteria.","Cartlidge, J."
96,korb_multilevel_2004,Multilevel selection and social evolution of insect societies,2004-01-01,"How sterile, altruistic worker castes have evolved in social insects and how they are maintained have long been central topics in evolutionary biology. With the advance of kin selection theory, insect
societies, in particular those of haplodiploid bees, ants, and wasps, have become highly suitable model systems for investigating the details of social evolution and recently also how within-group
conflicts are resolved. Because insect societies typically do not consist of clones, conflicts among nestmates arise, for example about the partitioning of reproduction and the allocation of resources
towards male and female sexuals. Variation in relatedness among group members therefore appears to have a profound influence on the social structure of groups. However, insect societies appear to be
remarkably robust against such variation: division of labor and task allocation are often organized in more or less the same way in societies with high as in those with very low nestmate relatedness.
To explain the discrepancy between predictions from kin structure and empirical data, it was suggested that constraints—such as the lack of power or information—prevent individuals from pursuing their
own selfish interests. Applying a multilevel selection approach shows that these constraints are in fact group-level adaptation preventing or resolving intracolonial conflict. The mechanisms of
conflict resolution in insect societies are similar to those at other levels in the biological hierarchy (e.g., in the genome or multicellular organisms): alignment of interests, fair lottery, and
social control. Insect societies can thus be regarded as a level of selection with novelties that provide benefits beyond the scope of a solitary life. Therefore, relatedness is less important for the
maintenance of insect societies, although it played a fundamental role in their evolution.","Korb, Judith and Heinze, J�rgen"

explanation for the large-scale patterns in the history of life (macroevolution). In general, population geneticists have argued in favor of microevolutionary extrapolation, whereas paleontologists
have sought to establish an autonomous and hierarchical macroevolutionary theory based on the operation of selection at several levels of biological organization (especially species). The massive
variation in eukaryotic genome sizes (haploid nuclear DNA contents, or “C-values”) has similarly been a subject of debate for more than half a century, and it has become clear that no one-dimensional
explanation can account for it. In this article, the basic concepts of macroevolutionary theory are reviewed and then applied to the long-standing puzzle of genome size variation (the “C-value
enigma”). Genome size evolution provides a clear example of hierarchy in action and therefore lends support to the theoretical approach of macroevolutionists. Perhaps more importantly, it is apparent
that genome evolution cannot be understood without such a hierarchical approach, thereby providing an intriguing conceptual link between the most reductionistic and expansive subjects of evolutionary
study.","Gregory, T. Ryan"

between social groups; for Darwin, between individuals; and for Freud, within individuals. Historically, for each of these levels of organization, ideas were developed first for humans and then later
for other organisms. In the case of struggle between individuals, it was of course Darwin who took ideas about competition between individuals for resources from classical economics and applied them
with spectacular success to other species. For social groups, Marx restricted his discussion to humans, and only later were Marxian ideas (in the broad sense of invoking struggle between social
groups) applied to other species, with varying degrees of success (Kropotkin 1902; Wynne-Edwards 1962; Sober and Wilson 1998). In pioneering the idea of intraindividual conflict, Freud was arguably
the most original of the Big Three. Although humans subjectively experience conflicting desires, and though it had long been commonplace to invoke a struggle between the spirit and the flesh, Freud’s
was the first serious attempt to construct a materialistic model of a composite self consisting of imperfectly integrated components. It is a mark of Freud’s originality that the first serious work of
Freudian biology (in the broad sense of invoking struggle within individuals) did not appear until 1967, with the publication of W. D. Hamilton’s seminal paper on extraordinary sex ratios. It may be a
misleading formalism to lump Freud and Hamilton together under the rubric of intraindividual conflict. I don’t suppose that Hamilton ever cited Freud as an influence. And yet, when Hamilton reminisces
about the insights that went into the 1967 paper, and muses about their implications, he seems to re-derive a broadly Freudian view of the human subconscious (and even to conduct a successful self-
analysis):","Normark, Benjamin B."

charrs existed in periglacial environments just beyond the fringes of great ice sheets. The charrs of eastern North America evolved and live in close and intimate association with ice in all its
various natural forms. The aquatic environments in which they evolved were cold, unproductive, sediment laden, and often catastrophically unstable. Even during times like the current interglacial,
seasonal ice conditions influence their environment. Ice can limit movement and confine fish during winter to groundwater fed refuge areas in rivers or to deep waters. In rivers, spawning grounds may
be delimited by suitable groundwater upwellings needed to protect eggs and embryos from ice. In lakes, ice thickness and, often, groundwater upwellings help define suitable spawning areas which often
occur in ice molded glacial deposits. Not surprisingly, many of the traits displayed by eastern North American charrs can be recognized as beneficial in cold regions. Particularly valuable is their
opportunistic, exploratory, and migratory behaviour which helps define their life history. These traits were presumably selected during life in periglacial areas and would have been useful for
dispersal whenever ice sheets retracted. It is unlikely these traits will promote survival under present circumstances when human activity is rapidly modifying their environment. However, should
modern technology enable the necessary information to be obtained and, with guidance, society responds appropriately, it is possible the charrs will persist into the future.","Power, Geoffrey"

the condition of the organism; therefore, the networks of trails must change both quantitatively and qualitatively over time. The nature of such changes, and how they are controlled at the individual
level are discussed. In particular, we show that slight modulations in individual traits, in the trail marker, or in the size of the group can account for major changes in movement patterns at the
population level such as abrupt transitions from diffuse area-covering networks to focused trunk trails. Using a mathematical model and computer (cellular automata) simulation we show that trunk
trails carrying a high density of traffic can form spontaneously under suitable conditions from an initially randomly distributed group. The key to this self-organizing property stems from
interactions between individuals that lead to a “collective effect” in recruitment to trails: the influence of small groups of individuals increases rapidly with group size. The dichotomy between high
traffic (strong) trunk trails versus diffuse (weak) networks is discussed.","Edelstein-Keshet, Leah and Watmough, James and Ermentrout, G. Bard"

incubation were tested in a colony of Fiordland crested penguins (E. pachyrhynchus). Neither hypothesis was supported. Although first eggs experienced greater mortality than second eggs, losses were
not associated with aggressive behavior or the degree of nest crowding. First eggs hatched later than second eggs and were found more often in the anterior (previously assumed inferior) nest position.
However, that position was not thermally disadvantaged, nor were lower temperatures consistently recorded from the smaller eggs. Parental brood patches did not form until after the first egg was laid;

owl species. These studies were carried out between September 1984 and June 1987. The birds were individually marked with transmitter packages so that their locomotional movements could be monitored.
Using a standard protable stimulus (a dummy with an attached loudspeaker) the territorial boundaries of 19 male Little Owls were surveilled during the different seasons of the year. Male Little Owls
defended their territories in all seasons, but distinct seasonal changes of intraspecific aggressiveness and territory size were observed. The seasonal variations of territory size followed a common
pattern in all studied Little Owls, in spite of individual differences in the size of the defended areas. The largest territories were defended in March/April during the courtship season
\$\$({\textbackslash}tilde x = 28.1 ha)\$\$ . In May/June all male Little Owls reduced the size of their territories  \$\$({\textbackslash}tilde x = 12.6 ha)\$\$ . This corresponds to the breeding and
nestling period. The yearly minimum of territory size  \$\$({\textbackslash}tilde x = 1.6 ha)\$\$ was reached in the summer months July and August when the fledglings were still fed in the parental
territory. When the first-year birds started to disperse in autumn (September/October), the size of the defended areas of the adult tenants again increased  \$\$({\textbackslash}tilde x = 9.5 ha)\$\$
. In winter (November to February), a further increase in territory size was observed for periods of warm weather  \$\$({\textbackslash}tilde x = 19.8 ha)\$\$ . Male Little Owls, however, were less
aggressive during winter than in the following courtship season. On cold winter days with a ground cover of snow territorial aggressiveness ceased. Pastures and meadows offered a continuous food
supply almost throughout the year. In some seasons they were overproportionally represented in the territories of Little Owls compared to the general surroundings. In reaction to changing
accessibility of food, the hunting ranges within the home ranges were shifted much faster than the boundaries of the defended territories. The significance of various factors contributing to the
variability of territory size in Little Owls are discussed (e.g. availability of food, seasonal and individual differences in aggressiveness, experience in the occupied area, population density).","Finck, Peter"

seen alive on the area over the winter, and many were found dead, whereas nearly all old birds that kept their territories were still there in spring. The number of birds in spring and the fate of
individuals over winter were predicted reasonably accurately from observations of behaviour in the previous November–December. Thus, differences of social class in autumn were critical to a bird's
survival to breed in the next summer and to its chances of contesting for territory and breeding in subsequent years.","Watson, Adam"

Because females attach eggs directly onto bare stone, a
spawning bout necessarily decreases the surface area available for further breeding at a nest. In apparent response to the female preference of ovipositing on rocks with the most bare surface, fathers
abandon nests with their attached offspring to search for rocks with more uncovered surface. Egg abandonment also results after roving fathers intercept and spawn with ripe females and remain at a
different rock to care for a new clutch. In essence, large males appear to maximize the number of eggs they fertilize by sequentially monopolizing breeding patches that are temporarily most desirable
to females. The costs to a father of abandoning his eggs appear to be low for two reasons: (1) non-territorial males, created by a scarcity of suitable rocks, readily occupy vacant nests, and clean
and aerate the abandoned eggs; and (2) after water hardening, eggs are less vulnerable to cannibalism. The maintenance of eggs by nonparental males may be both incidental to scrubbing the ceiling for
their own breeding and adaptive in that viable eggs stimulate females to spawn; neither would appear to involve parental investment costs. Thus, allopaternal care in the tessellated darter may have
evolved because it is performed in the selfish pursuit of spawning opportunities while entailing little, if any, of the costs normally subsumed within parental investment.","Constantz, George D."

extrinsically if the equilibrium is a mechanical consequence of interaction between the population and the organisms providing its food. We suggest that, at least for mammalian herbivores, self-
regulation is unlikely to evolve unless the population's intrinsic rate of increase exceeds about 0.45 on a yearly basis. That value corresponds to a body weight of about 30 kg, the intrinsic rate
being related inversely to body weight by rm=1.5 W-0.36 with W in kg.The two dynamic strategies, self-regulation and extrinsic regulation, should enforce a bimodality of the frequency distribution of
observed intrinsic rates of increase. This in turn might be reflected in a bimodality of body sizes, the smaller herbivores constituting the lower mode generally showing intrinsic regulation and the
larger herbivores of the upper mode generally being regulated by extrinsic mechanisms. There is some empirical support for these predictions but it is by no means clearcut.Mechanisms of self-
regulation can evolve either by individual or group selection. Individual selection may act in two ways. By inhibiting their neighbours with some form of interference, individuals may increase their
relative fitness without increasing their reproductive rate. Alternatively, individual selection may raise the absolute fitness of individuals and thereby raise the populations's intrinsic rate of
increase. The population is destabilized if that process continues beyond a certain threshold and the population is then at significant risk of extinction at the troughs of the consequent
oscillations. Selection between such populations will favour those carrying the beginnings of a self-regulating mechanism, and with that mechanism strengthened and fixed by continuing group selection,
individual selection is again freed of the dynamic restraints on raising further the intrinsic rate of increase.","Caughley, Graeme and Krebs, Charles J."

Patterns of habitat patch occupancy elucidated in previous studies of cotton rats (Sigmodon
hispidus) suggested that spacing behavior might be an important factor in population regulation of this species. In this study, habitat selection experiments in enclosures indicated that cotton rats
preferred patches with shrubs present. However, this preference was density-dependent with more equal habitat occurrence at higher densities. Two experimental patchy habitats were created in open
fields and were composed of alternating 0.2-ha squares with overhead shrub cover for possible predator protection present (preferred habitat) and with shrub cover removed by mowing. It was
hypothesized that subordinate animals would occupy less preferred patches, thus exhibiting reduced fitness.Animals captured in patches with shrubs were larger, moved greater distances, and were in
reproductive condition more often than animals in patches without shrubs. There was only a slight difference in survival rates between patch types, however. Behavioral encounters between animals
captured in the two patch types resulted in animals from patches with shrubs exhibiting significantly more dominance-type behavior and winning encounters significantly more often than those from
patches without shrubs.Results suggested that spacing behavior is important in regulating habitat occurrence of cotton rats. Dominant animals were able to occupy preferred habitat patches. It seems
that dominance serves to ameliorate the increase in population density/unit area in good habitat by influencing the movement of subordinates into less preferred habitat. Normal mortality factors then
decrease density in all habitats, whereupon density increases begin in good habitat and again spread into poorer habitat types.","Spencer, Stephen R. and Cameron, Guy N."

of a given theme and respond more often and more quickly to the familiar dialect. A social influence on the choice of theme by the individual can also be observed in foraging flocks and roosts where
song is frequently given. Observation of such groups reveal that one theme predominates on each given occasion and that it depends on the number of individuals present and on the type of group (flock
or roost). This is probably a function of the tendency to match. Previous observations of flights toward the roost showed that birds originating from different dialectal areas congregate in such

is, a density-dependent factor is any component of the environment whose intensity is correlated with population density and whose action affects survival and reproduction. This definition is used in
evaluating the role of territorial behavior, the availability of nest sites, and competition in determining the size of a population. Because neither territory size nor the number of nest sites is
correlated with either density or with changes in the birth and death rates of these populations, these cannot be considered density-dependent factors. Competition determines who does breed and who
does not rather than the number of breeders, and thus it is not a density-dependent factor determining a population's size.","Murray, Bertram G."

only those in the posterior-most segments produce gametes and become incorporated into the developing stolon. The more anterior gonads remain undifferentiated and probably sexually undetermined until
they are needed in future stolonizations. Gonial cells, which will eventually become either male or female, are ultrastructurally identical at the onset of each stolonization period. Spermatogenesis
is marked by a short proliferative period followed by differentiation and spermiogenesis. The first ultrastructural signs of spermatogenesis were found in coelomic spermatogonia on day 10 of stolon
formation. Spermatogonia are joined by intercellular bridges, which are maintained until the early spermatid stage. Synaptonemal complexes mark the onset of meiosis, which is apparently synchronized
in the syncytial clusters of primary spermatocytes. Spermiogenesis occurs during the final 10 days of stolonization and a variety of stages is present within a single animal. All sperm mature by the

102,gross_predation_1981,Predation and the evolution of colonial nesting in bluegill sunfish ({Lepomis} macrochirus),1981-01-01,"Summary1.Male bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) construct nests in densely packed colonies characterized by high breeding synchrony. Females deposit eggs in the nests and males alone provide
parental care for eggs and larvae. During the 7-day care period, males do not leave the nests to forage nor do they nourish the young. Parental males do actively defend their broods against
predators.2.This study investigated the effects of coloniality on predation. Bluegill brood are attacked by predators moving along the lake substrate and from the water column. Substrate-level
predators include a major predator in the system, the snail Viviparous georgianus, and also bullhead, Ictalurus spp. Predation from the water column is primarily by conspecifics (94\%) but also by
Lepomis gibbosus and the hybrid, L. macrochirus x L. gibbosus. There is little or no predation on parental males.3.Significant differences in brood predation are found among nests in central,
peripheral colony and solitary sites. Brood loss at peripheral nests is at least three times that at central nests, and solitary nests experience greater predation than colony nests. These differences
are due to effects of nest dispersion rather than to habitat characteristics.4.Bluegill brood predation is reduced through colonial nesting as (1) peripheral nests screen central broods from snails
and bullhead, (2) predators can be swamped by the high nesting density, and (3) overlapping defended zones provide cumulative defense against water-column predators and bullhead. Synchrony in breeding
augments these anti-predation attributes of colonial nesting, and can also reduce conspecific predation and result in a ‘head-start’ against predators.5.Certain costs to brood survivorship arise from
colonial nesting: predation by neighboring males and ripe females, concentration of odor cues which may influence bullhead predation, and possibly fungal transmission between nests.6.Pumpkinseed
sunfish (L. gibbosus), which breed concurrently with bluegill, are relatively unsocial nesters. Pumpkinseed do not suffer the same predation pressures. As a result of morphological and behavioral
adaptations for feeding, pumpkinseed are able to remove snails from their nests and probably repel bullhead attacks. As snails contribute over 50\% of the estimated predation on bluegill, this
difference between species is significant.7.Brood predation is proposed as an important selective force for the evolution of colonial nesting in sunfishes. Selection should be mediated through female
choice of a nest dispersion which maximizes brood survivorship. Morphological and behavioral preadaptations probably determine the type and degree of brood predation experienced by a species, and
hence species-specific selection for patterns of nest dispersion.","Gross, Mart R. and MacMillan, Anne M."

differential effects of coloration on pair success, all four combinations of sex and color were observed, first separated by a transparent screen, then together. The normal size relation was used,
i.e., the female about 85\% the weight of the male.2.Time to spawn showed no difference according to pair types with or without the screen, but the pairs that formed without the screen spawned more
quickly than those with it. Failure to pair due to the male attacking the female, without the screen, occurred faster in pairs with normal than in those with gold females. The combination least able
to form a pair was gold male x normal female.3.Mixed-color pairs were then tested with the females half or equal to the weight of the males. Equal-sized mates in gold male x normal female pairs
resulted in pair success comparable to “normal” levels. Other studies indicate that gold color inhibits aggression. Apparently the combination of larger size and gold color makes the gold male too
intimidating for the normal female, while making the female as large as the male compensates for the male's gold color.","Barlow, George W. and Rogers, William and Cappeto, Rocco V."

Intraspecific competition is assumed to be a
function of the number of distinct pair encounters between 2 individuals of differing colony origin. A model is offered which describes the reduction in the number of potential competing encounters as
a result of colonialism, and as such, combinatorial formulae are appropriate. For 2-colony and multi-colony systems, there is a proportionately smaller number of potential competing encounters as the
size of the colonies becomes more inequitable and greater than 100 individuals in combined total. As a consequence, large inequitabilities in colony sizes are expected for nearest neighbor pairs, and
thus a generally large variance in colony size for groups of colonies is also expected. Empirical data from various sources is presented and in good agreement with the predictions generated from the
model.","De Vita, Joseph"
28,holst_renal_1972,Renal failure as the cause of death {inTupaia} belangeri exposed to persistent social stress,1972-01-01,"1. An adult male Tupaia belangeri was introduced to another male which was an experienced fighter. The latter immediately attacked the newcomer and subjugated him (Figs. 1 and 2). The two animals were
subsequently separated, so that the subordinate animal could see the victor permanently, but could not be attacked by him. The fight and subjugation were repeated every 1-2 days, in order to maintain
dominance relationships. Changes in physiological parameters were determined by sacrificing some of the tree-shrews at 2-16 days after the first subjugation, 80-100 minutes before the onset of daily
activity. 2. After the first subjugation, subordinate animals lie still in a corner for more than 90 \% of the daily activity-phase and follow the movements of the victors with their heads. The tail-
hair is continuously raised, indicating persistent activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Subordinate animals eat as long as controls. 3. After 2-16 days, the skin-temperature of the
subordinates abruptly falls from more than 35{\textasciitilde} to less than 30{\textasciitilde} within 24 hours. Cramps and paralysis appear in the extremities, the tree-shrews fall into coma and die.
Wounds can be excluded as the cause of death. 4. The following physiological changes take place in the subordinate animals: a) The animals lose body weight in a linear fashion. The rate of weight-loss
varies considerably between animals (Fig. 3). The more weight an animal loses daily, the more rapidly it dies (r {\textasciitilde} 0.89; Fig. 4). Death is not a result of inadequate energy-supply
(resp. hypoglyeaemia). b) In subordinates, the glycogen content of the liver is significantly below that of controls (p{\textasciitilde}0.003; Table 1); but even dying animals may exhibit normal
glycogen values. The glucose concentration of the blood is the same under both conditions (Table 1). c) The haemoglobin content of the blood decreases during stress exposure (r {\textasciitilde} 0.75;
Fig. 5). The decrease is the more rapid, the more weight a subordinate animal loses daily (r{\textasciitilde}0.68). The decrease in haemoglobin concentration is primarily due to haemolysis, but
erythropoiesis is also restricted (Table 2). d) The kidney weight decreases with continued stress; animals sacrificed more than 10 days after their first subjugation have kidneys approximately 17 \%
lighter than those of controls (p {\textless} 0.05; Fig. 8). e) During the course of stress, urea-N content of the blood increases (Fig. 6). The more rapidly the urea-N increases, the more rapid is
the decrease in blood haemoglobin content ( r {\textasciitilde} 0.89). Subordinate animals can move around normally with values up to 150 mg urea-N/100 ml blood, and they look healthy. If the
concentration rises above this level, symptoms of imminent death appear, and the animals die.","Holst, Dietrich v."

their function is, however, hindered by the highly complex behaviour of mammals and the fact that skin glands are not indispensable.Unlike insects which often respond unconditionally to olfactory
stimuli the behavioural responses of mammals are often obscure and detectable only on a physiological level. In higher animals the reaction to the same odour-stimulus may vary from individual to
individual depending not only on its physiological state but also on its social status, group membership or previous experience. Although it is true that in the absence of the olfactory sense other
senses compensate for its absence, according to psychoanalysts normal (sexual) development depends on an unimpaired sensorium. Perfect sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell-perception and production
assure a more efficient relationship between an individual and its physical and social environment.","Mykytowycz, R."

While the 2 0 {\textasciitilde} century focus on self-interest has
received support from traditional Darwinian theory, there is currently renewed interest in prosocial emotions, due to factors such as work by experimental economists and a reconsideration of group
selection within biology. The dissertation has two parts, related by the common theme of altruistic preferences. Part 1 examines the debate on which units are subject to Darwinian selection. Do these
units include genes, organisms andor groups of organisms? Due to difficulty in explaining altruism as an organism level adaptation, biologists proposed that selection might act upon groups allowing
for group level adaptations. During the 1960s and 1970s, group selection fell into disrepute. Various models suggested that it was unlikely to be biologically important and alternate explanations of
altruism were provided. Currently, although group selection is receiving serious reconsideration, the ""units of selection debate"" remains unresolved. I argue that this failure is due to widespread
acceptance that the largest replicators (heredity units of selection) correspond to genes. It is proposed here that replicators exist at a variety of levels, including genes, organisms and groups.
Higher level replicators are constructed from lower level replicators via inheritable strategies for assortment into groups, allowing for adaptations at multiple levels. Part 2 examines some potential
effects of altruistic preferences for behaviour and information. When making decisions, altruists attempt to account for both private material net benefits and external consequences. High private
material benefits may lead to asocial choices, but at the cost of negative social emotions, i.e. ""cognitive dissonance"". Dissonance can be reduced ex post by ""selectively exposure"" to (choosing or
avoiding) information sources that report that one's behaviour is respectively prosocial or asocial. The aggregate effects of such ""selective attention"" affect information demand potentially biasing
information sources, which can then affect behaviour in two-way feedback with potential for lock in to low welfare equilibrium. The dynamics of activity choices and information are modeled with
application to 1) transition from feudal to market economies, and 2) environmental damages and policy.","Forsdyke, R."

of nitrogenous food for the very young. Any component of the environment of a plant, by varying the amount of adequately nutritious plant tissue available to herbivores, may consequently affect the
abundance of food through all subsequent trophic levels; in this regard weather may be important more often than is immediately obvious.The hypothesis proposes that animals live in a variably
inadequate environment wherein many are born but few survive, and leads to a concept of populations being “limited from below” rather than “controlled from above”. And it may lead to a reappraisal of
the role of predation, competition and social and territorial behaviour as factors likely to influence the numbers of animals in the environment, the response of “pests” to manipulation of populations
of their food plants by Man, and the likely effectiveness of agents of biological control.","White, T. C. R."

One
hypotheses assumes an independent rhythm in plant food production and the other gradual overgrazing. The findings were also compared with predictions from hypotheses on self-regulation of rodent
populations.2.Two vole species, representing one herbivore and one partial granivore, were sampled in South, Central and North Sweden in 1971–1975. A two year population peak was found in both species
in North Sweden, a one year peak in Central Sweden and no obvious peak at all in South Sweden.3.Weather conditions, primary production of various plants and chemical composition of food plants were
examined in the same regions. Food conditions improved for at least herbivorous rodents during the increases and before peaks in density in Central and North Sweden. Similar annual variations appeared
in plant production in South Sweden without any accompanying numerical changes in the rodent populations.4.In certain respects neither hypothesis could be refuted. However, the observations did not
favour the ideas of self-regulation. Thus a new hypothesis is proposed. It assumes that in certain areas small rodents and their predators show a dynamic balance with the rodents below the food
resource limitation. However, in disturbed habitats or areas with much snow, predation is difficult. There the herbivorous rodents may overexploit their food but at the same time may be affected by a
several-year rhythm in the food plants.","Hansson, Lennart"

Gonial clusters, consisting of six to eight syncytial sibling cells, are surrounded by gonial peritoneum and are

eventually to become a mature oocyte. Yolk is composed of lipid droplets and membranebound protein granules. The protein component appears to be at least partially synthesized by the oocyte although
there are some signs of endocytosis. Nurse cells and peritoneal cells are apparently able to manufacture some protein that may also be utilized by the oocyte. The nurse cells maintain cytoplasmic
continuity with the oocyte, and mitochondria and ribosomes are often seen within the intercellular bridges between oocyte and nurse cell. Immediately prior to spawning, oocytes undergo prematuration

From 1965 to 1969 it received only ten citations; yet from 1978 to 1980 it received 82. There seem to be two main reasons for this pattern. First, in 1965, the number
of persons working in the areas that today are called behavioral ecology or sociobiology was miniscule. Roughly half a dozen names spring to mind; today, perhaps 200. Second, it happened
serendipitously that a basic concept that was developed in primitive form in the 1964 paper, the idea of 'economic defendability,' proved to have heuristic value for some beautiful empirical studies
done later on the energetic costs and benefits of territorial behavior by Wolf, Gill, Carpenter, and others.These studies attracted attention to the 1964 paper. The 'economic' approach is now widely
used in behavioral ecology. ""When it was written, the subject of this paper was far removed from my research interests, which then were in the new field of neuro-ethology. It would not have been
written at all except for a coincidence of two events, one scientific and one personal. In 1962, a heavy book appeared that misinterpreted nearly all of animal social behavior according to the theory
of interdemic selection, instead of the conventional individual selection. Territorial behavior was the principal test case. Believing that a response was required because many naive readers would be
swayed by the 'weight' of evidence for interdemic selection, I felt that two avenues of response were open, to reinterpret all the evidence in the book, or to present a brief and simple statement of
the alternative approach. I chose the latter. Although this approach was widely known, it had not previously been set down succinctly in one publication. My version of it was, I thought, conventional
and unoriginal. I suspect that others would have soon written similar thoughts had I not responded so promptly. ""I would not have troubled to write the 1964 paper had I been immersed in research in
October 1962. By chance, however, I was caught in a slack period. I had just arrived at a new campus for my first academic job, and I was waiting for some electronic equipment to arrive to begin my
experiments in avian neuro-ethology. I had already written up my graduate and postdoctoral work and was waiting for responses from coauthors. This left me with time to read and write about anything
that came to mind. ""In graduate school, 1952-1960, I had moved from a background in evolutionary biology and systematics into the relatively new areas of ecology and behavior. My interest in the
action of natural selection on territorial behavior was a logical outgrowth of this combination. An excellent review of recent work in this area has been provided by Wittenberger's new book, Animal

enforcement of the norm. The main result is that such memes coevolve with personal tastes and capacities so as to produce the optimal level of negative reciprocity.","Friedman, Daniel and Singh, Nirvikar"

Recent experiments on cyclic red grouse populations discovered that aggressiveness, induced by testosterone implants, depressed population density for more than a year after the implants
were exhausted. 2. This confirms the observation, also made in previous studies of this territorial species, that aggressiveness can determine population density. Additionally, it hints at a form of
social memory that sustains the effect of episodes of high aggressiveness after their cause has ceased to exist. 3. We explore the logical consequences of this observation with a simple model of the
interaction between population density and aggressiveness. A flexible function describes how aggressiveness changes from year to year as a function of population density. At low densities animals are
tolerant to conspecifics and aggressiveness falls from one year to the next. Conversely, at high densities aggressiveness rises. 4. In the model, current aggressiveness is set by aggressiveness in the
previous year, and modified by last year’s population density (first version) or by current population density (second version). 5. We assume no particular behavioural mechanism underlying this
process but derive conditions under which changes in aggressiveness, effected by density, can generate unstable dynamics. 6. The two versions of the model give fluctuations that differ in period and
amplitude but have similar conditions for unstable dynamics. Specifically, the more abrupt the transition from tolerant to intolerant behaviour with increasing density, the more likely are cycles to
occur. 7. We show how a previous model of the kinship hypothesis for red grouse cycles can be recast in the current terminology, and how the new models offer a more general way of examining red grouse
population dynamics.","Mougeot, Francois and Redpath, Steve M. and Moss, Robert and Matthiopoulos, Jason and Hudson, Peter J."

In
mammals, the great range in body size allows us to see how allometric relationships affect the mode of regulation. Resource limitation is the fundamental cause of regulation. Top–down limitation
through predators is determined by four factors: (i) body size; (ii) the diversity of predators and prey in the system; (iii) whether prey are resident or migratory; and (iv) the presence of
alternative prey for predators. Body size in mammals has two important consequences. First, mammals, particularly large species, can act as keystones that determine the diversity of an ecosystem. I
show how keystone processes can, in principle, be measured using the example of the wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, mammals act as ecological landscapers by altering vegetation
succession. Mammals alter physical structure, ecological function and species diversity in most terrestrial biomes. In general, there is a close interaction between allometry, population regulation,
life history and ecosystem dynamics. These relationships are relevant to applied aspects of conservation and pest management.","Sinclair, A. R. E."

Depending on the
population parameters, like death rate per generation and size of the competition and mating neighborhoods, isolated groups of individuals, or demes, may appear. The existence of such groups in a
population has consequences for genetic diversity and for speciation. In this paper we discuss the robustness of demes formation with respect to two important characteristics of the population: the
way individuals recognize the demarcation of the local neighborhoods and the way competition for resources affects the birth rate in an overcrowed situation. Our results indicate that demes are
expected to form only for sufficiently sharp demarcations and for sufficiently intense competition.","Aguiar, M.A.M. de and Baranger, M. and Bar-Yam, Y. and Sayama, H."

Stankowich, Psychology Department, Young Hall, One Shields Avenue, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, U.S.A. (email: tstankowich@ucdavis.edu). Biologists have studied group
dynamics and attempted to define the benefits of gregariousness across diverse taxa for several decades. The relative costs and benefits of group living (reviewed in Krause \& Ruxton 2002) may differ
between group members so that each is under selection to maximize its individual fitness in different ways (Rubenstein 1978). For example, individuals on the edge of a group may have higher feeding
rates but suffer higher predation risk, whereas those on the inside enjoy lower rates of predation but suffer reduced feeding rates (e.g. colonial spiders: Rayor \& Uetz 1990). Many years ago
ornithologists studying predation rates in colonialnesting birds reported that predation rates on eggs or fledglings were higher for solitary nests outside of the colony than for those inside the
colony, and positions on the periphery of the colony were more susceptible to predation than central positions (e.g. Taylor 1962; Kruuk 1964; Patterson 1965). This phenomenon of differential predation
risk within a group (i.e. a greater risk of predation on the periphery relative to the centre) is known as ‘marginal predation’. Similar early studies found the same phenomenon of differential risk in
mobile animals (e.g. mammals: Galton 1871; birds: Wynne-Edwards 1962). Following these early studies, several mathematical and geometrical models of the benefits of group formation emerged, the most
famous of which is Hamilton’s (1971) theory of the ‘selfish herd’, in which aggregations of animals form purely by selfish behaviour of individuals. Hamilton’s (1971) predictions were echoed and
extended by Vine (1971) and since have been refined and formalized by computer models to show how within-group movements of individuals during attacks may minimize their individual predation risk
(e.g. Morton et al. 1994; Gueron et al. 1996; Barta et al. 1997; Beecham \& Farnsworth 1999; Viscido et al. 2001). While Hamilton’s (1971) ideas have been the inspiration behind most of the
theoretical issues at hand, the problem with analysing the empirical validity of these models is that we do not have standardized methodologies for measuring marginal predation and benefits of
aggregation.","Stankowich, Theodore"

Simultaneously, more sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems is needed. A better understanding of natural
selection can help solve both problems. We illustrate this point with two specific examples. First, the genetic legacy of crop plants has been refined by millions of years of natural selection, often
driven by competition among plants. We therefore suggest that most simple, tradeoff‐free options to increase competitiveness (e.g., increased gene expression, or minor modifications of existing plant
genes) have already been tested by natural selection. Further genetic improvement of crop yield potential over the next decade will mainly involve tradeoffs, either between fitness in past versus
present environments, or between individual competitiveness and the collective performance of plant communities. Eventually, we may develop the ability to predict the consequences of genetic
alterations so radical that they have not yet been tested by natural selection. Second, natural selection acts mainly at the level of genes, individuals, and family groups, rather than ecosystems as a
whole. Consequently, there is no reason to expect the structure of natural ecosystems (diversity, spatial, or temporal patterns) to be a reliable blueprint for agricultural ecosystems. Natural
ecosystems are nonetheless an important source of information that could be used to improve agriculture.","Denison, R. Ford and Kiers, E. Toby and West, Stuart A."

St Kilda were the ancestral populations from which essentially all other colonies in the region were derived. We collected samples from seven breeding colonies around the North Atlantic and used
mitochondrial DNA analysis to ask whether population structure was present and, if so, where there was evidence about which colony was the dominant source population. Our data reveal a pattern
consistent with isolation by distance, suggesting that, even though capable of flying great distances, most birds return to breed either at their own or neighbouring colonies. Interestingly, although
most colonizers appear to have come originally from Iceland, our analysis also identifies St Kilda as a possible source. However, this secondary pattern appears to be largely an artefact, and can be
attributed to the low haplotype diversity on St Kilda which yields a much clearer isolation by distance signal than that generated by birds dispersing from Iceland, where haplotype diversity is
extremely high. Consequently, we urge caution when interpreting patterns in which populations vary greatly in the genetic diversity they harbour.","Burg, T. M. and Lomax, J. and Almond, R. and Brooke, M. de L. and Amos, W."

characteristic form of such species–range size distributions has previously been raised. This would require that closely related species have similar range sizes, an indication of “heritability” of
range sizes at the species level. Support for this view came from a positive correlation between the range sizes of closely related pairs of fossil mollusc species. We extend this analysis by
considering the relationship between the geographic range sizes of 103 pairs of contemporary avian sister species. Range sizes in these sister species show no evidence of being more similar to each
other than expected by chance. A reassessment of the mollusc data also suggests that the high correlation was probably overestimated because of the skewed nature of range size data. The fact that
sister species tend to have similar life histories and ecologies suggests that any relationship between range sizes and biology is likely to be complicated and will be influenced by historical
factors, such as mode of speciation and postspeciation range size transformations.","Webb, Thomas J. and Gaston, Kevin J."

Here, we consider it a distinct habitat (sensu Fretwell 1972), i.e.
fitness is relatively homogeneous among ducks within the MAV but different from that of ducks in other such habitats. We analyzed recovery distributions of Mallards banded preseason (July-September
1950-1980) to test hypotheses concerning the effects of winter temperatures, precipitation, and population levels on Mallard winter distribution. When two groups of years that comprised extremes of
warm and cold winter weather were compared, recovery distributions of all four age and sex classes (adult males and females, young males and females) differed significantly; recoveries were located
farther south in cold years. Recovery distributions also differed between wet and dry years in the MAV for all groups except adult males, higher proportions of recoveries of adult females and of young
males and females occurring in the MAV during wet winters. Although differences in continental Mallard population size were associated with differences in recovery distributions only of adult males
and young females, the proportion of young males and of all young Mallards recovered in the MAV increased during years of low populations. We conclude that temperature, water conditions, and
population size affect the habitat suitability of Mallard wintering areas and that Mallards exhibit considerable flexibility in winter distribution associated with these factors. Received 25 October
1982, accepted 30 March 1983. MIGRATORY birds travel substantial distances each year and must select appropriate summer, migration, and winter habitats. If the relative suitability, defined in terms
of expected fitness (see Fretwell 1972), of potential summer or winter residences varies annually, and if such variation can be perceived by birds, then we might expect corresponding variation in
choices of seasonal residences. A number of possible benefits associated with returning to the same areas each year, however, can also be imagined (e.g. ""familiarity"" with the distribution of food
resources, nest or roost sites, predators, etc.). We would expect the degree of variation in choice of seasonal residence to be largely determined by the magnitude and variation of these sorts of
relative ""costs"" and ""benefits."" Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are widely distributed in the Holarctic and have been studied extensively in both North America and Europe. A number of workers have
suggested that Mallards generally return in subsequent winters to the area in which they spend their initial winter (Munro 1943, Cartwright and Law 1952, Boyd and Ogilvie 1961, Crissey 1965, Gollop
932 unpubl. data), whereas others believe that Mallards may winter in different areas depending on such factors as winter weather conditions and food availability (Pulliainen 1963, Lensink 1964,
Bellrose and Crompton 1970, Nilsson 1973). Nichols and Hines (in prep.) recently completed an extensive analysis of winter bandrecovery records for North American Mallards and concluded that birds
from specific breeding areas do exhibit some temporal variation in wintering-ground location. They further concluded that young (first year) birds appeared less likely to return to specific wintering
areas in subsequent years than did adults. The Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV; see Fig. 1) is an extremely important wintering area for North American Mallards (see Bellrose 1976) and exhibits
considerable year-to-year variation in the number of birds present. Bellrose and Crompton (1970: 222) suggested that Mallards in the Mississippi migration corridor (see Bellrose 1968) exhibit
""flexible homing to specific localities"" and that this flexibility is keyed to such environmental variables as ice, snow cover, and water availability. Despite these The Auk 100: 932-946. October 1983

The first was to test predictions of previous and new theories to explain variation in the timing of pair formation in waterfowl by investigating how several
aspects of the winter ecology of Harlequin Ducks, including distribution and spacing behaviour, time-activity budgets, and the use of herring spawn, may be related to the process of mate choice and
the timing of pair formation. The second was to identify and address some of the gaps in our knowledge of the winter ecology and demography of Harlequin Ducks that currently handicap effective
conservation action. Previous theory to account for variation in the timing of pairing, that primarily considered how phenotypic, social, and ecological factors affect male costs, poorly predicted
pairing behaviour in Harlequin Ducks and other waterfowl. Female Harlequin Ducks invested considerable time and energy into selecting a mate, and decisions by females about how much time and energy to
allocate to the pairing process appeared to be the main factor controlling the timing of pairing. Those decisions were affected by age, previous pairing experience, time required for other activities
due to seasonal differences in day-length and food availability, and group spacing that affected the availability and likely the costs of mate sampling and in turn was also related to food
availability. Spacing behaviour supported the hypothesis that unpaired birds will show adaptive changes in their spacing to reduce the costs of mate sampling. Aggregating at herring spawning sites in
March provided birds with both direct nutritional benefits and indirect benefits related to changes in time budgets and spacing behaviour. Male and female interests necessarily interacted and a
comprehensive theory to predict variation in pairing behaviour in waterfowl and other species requires consideration of benefits, costs, and conflicts of interest among individuals engaged in pairing
decisions. The process of making mate-choice decisions, how the interactions of phenotypic, social, and ecological conditions affect that process, and how individuals integrate that process with other
requirements of their life history are essential to consider in order to understand variation in the timing of pairing events. To R. Wayne Campbell","Rodway, M. S."

interaction between various sub-disciplines. The task for economists is to distinguish between insights directly relevant for economic theory and ones that hinge on unique features of biological
systems. We argue that both micro and macro processes drive economic change and that macroeconomic change cannot be explained by microlevel optimising alone. We show that debates in biology about
group selection and punctuated equilibria are relevant to understanding economic evolution. The opposition of reductionism and holism is of little use and, in its place, a hierarchical approach is

different equally correct ways. Second, there is a pluralism concerning what happens in nature – different types of selection process can and do occur in nature, and they occur in different
combinations. Whereas the first type of pluralism brings with it a kind of conventionalism, the second involves a kind of realism. It is a matter of convention which of two equivalent models you use

Regulation thus requires den- sity-dependent negative feedback
whereby the population has a propensity to increase when small and decrease when large. Ultimately, extinction occurs due to regulating mechanisms becoming weaker than various disruptive events and
stochastic variation. Population reg- ulation is one of the foundational concepts of ecology, yet this paradigm has often been challenged, during the first half of the 20th century when the concept
was not clearly defined, and more recently by some who study demographically open populations. The history of ecology reveals that earlier manifestations of the concept focused mostly on competition
as the mechanism of population regulation. Because competition is often not evident in nature, it was sometimes concluded that population regulation was therefore also absent. However, predation in
the broadest sense can also cause density dependence. By the 1950s, the idea that demographic density dependence was essential (but not suffi- cient) for population regulation was well established,
and since then, challenges to the general concept have been short lived. However, some now believe that metapopulations composed of demographically open local populations can persist without density
depen- dence. In particular, some recent manifestations of the Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis all but preclude the possibility of regulation. The theory of locally open populations indicates that
persistence always relies on direct demographic density dependence at some spatial and temporal scale, even in models re- portedly demonstrating the contrary. There is also increasing empirical
evidence, especially in marine systems where competition for space is not self evident, that local density de- pendence is more pervasive than previously assumed and is often caused by predation.
However, there are currently insufficient data to test unequivocally whether or not any persistent metapopulation is regulated. The challenge for more complete understanding of regulation of
metapopulations lies in combined empirical and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between smaller scale field experiments and larger scale phenomena that can pres- ently be explored solely by
theory.","Hixon, Mark A. and Pacala, Stephen W. and Sandin, Stuart A."

were influenced by interactions among neighboring individuals or different habitat preferences of different bird species. In order to identify the effects of the interactions among neighboring
individuals and habitat preference, we developed a randomization test in which species identifications were randomly allocated to the observed individual positions within areas with the same
vegetation structure. The randomization test indicated that individuals tend to have territories near the territories of individuals of the same species or of a particular species more frequently (or
less frequently) than those expected from random distributions of individuals. Among these associations, only one case was explained by individual interactions, and 19 cases were explained by habitat
preference. The results suggest that both individual interactions and habitat preference affected the spatial distributions of individuals and possibly influence the species compositions and diversity

Wigglesworth (228, p. 107) described some geneticists as being ""apologetic"" about environmentally cued polymorphisms, which they considered examples of unfortunate defects in the delicate genetic

techniques were primitive, but with the currently high population densities and widespread availability offirearms in Africa, it is inevitable that wildlife resources are being exterminated from
unprotected areas. The attitudes that underlie unsustainable wildlife harvesting are unlikely to change as long as social instability and poverty prevent rural Africans from being able to invest in

(e.g., Kuroda, 1960; Carpenter, 1953; Hinde, 1956), and the impossibility of providin g a specific answer applicable to all types of territoriality is now realized. Arguments over which are the
primary selection pressures leading to certain types of territoriality continue, however, as shown in the recent contributions bearing on the “function” of territoriality by Stenger (1958))

the attitudes of evolutionary biologists. First was grow­ ing acceptance of the evidence that the potency of natural selection is overwhelm­ ingly concentrated at levels no higher than that of the
individual. Second was revival of the comparative method, especially as applied to behavior and life histories. Third was spread of the realization that not only are all aspects of structure and
function of organisms to be understood solely as products of selection, but because of their peculiarly direct relationship to the forces of selection, behavior and life history phenomena, long
neglected by the evolutionists, may be among the most predictable of all phenotypic attributes. These ideas have been appreciated by a few biologists for a long time, but they have only recently begun
to characterize the science as a whole. Darwin's discussion of sterility between species as an incidental effect of evolutionary adaptation (41 , p . 260) and his refusal to deal with sex ratio
selection (42, p . 399) suggest an awareness of the difficult problem of determining the levels at which selection is most powerful. Yet significant clarification of this basic issue did not really
com­ mence until publication of Wynne-Edwards' massive volume (179) championing group selection and inadvertently exposing its unlikelihood. As late as 1958, Fisher felt constrained to add to the
revised edition of his 1929 classic, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, the admonishment (53, p. 49) that his fundamental theorem and its associated considerations, already misused then by
decades of population geneticists dealing (as they saw it) with the fitness of populations, refer strictly to ""the progressive modification of structure or function only in so far as variations in
these are of advantage to the individual . . . [and afford] no correspond­ ing explanation for any properties of animals and plants . . . supposed to be of service to the species to which they

Wilson's ""Darwin's Cathedral"" takes the radical step of joining the two, in the process proposing an evolutionary theory of religion that shakes both evolutionary biology and social theory at their
foundations. The key, argues Wilson, is to think of society as an organism, an old idea that has received new life based on recent developments in evolutionary biology. If society is an organism, can
we then think of morality and religion as biologically and culturally evolved adaptations that enable human groups to function as single units rather than mere collections of individuals? Wilson
brings a variety of evidence to bear on this question, from both the biological and social sciences. From Calvinism in 16th-century Geneva to Balinese water temples, from hunter-gatherer societies to
urban America, Wilson demonstrates how religions have enabled people to achieve by collective action what they never could do alone. He also includes a chapter considering forgiveness from an
evolutionary perspective and concludes by discussing how all social organizations, even science, could benefit by incoporating elements of religion. Religious believers often compare their communities
to single organisms and even to insect colonies. Astoundingly, Wilson shows that they might be literally correct. Intended for any educated reader, ""Darwin's Cathedral"" should change forever the way

vary in their relative abundances among distinct habitat patches (dry meadows) in a large network of ∼1,700 patches. We found no effect of host species use on local extinction. In contrast, population
establishment was strongly influenced by the match between the host species composition of an empty habitat patch and the relative host use by larvae in previous years in the habitat patches that were
well connected to the target patch. This “colonization effect” could be due to spatially variable plant acceptability or resistance or to spatially variable insect oviposition preference or larval
performance. We show that spatial variation in adult oviposition preference occurs at the relevant spatial scale and that the other possible causes of the colonization effect can be discounted. We
conclude that the colonization effect is generated by host preference influencing the movement patterns of ovipositing females. Migrant females with dissimilar host preferences have different
perceptions of relative patch quality, which influences their likelihood of colonizing patches with particular host composition.","Hanski, Ilkka and Singer, Michael C."

had an odourant or pheromone contacting an aqueous sensory lymph then movement through it to a receptor membrane beneath. If the odourant or pheromone were non-soluble, the odourant/pheromone
supposedly would be bound to a soluble protein in the lymph to be carried across. Thus, an odourant/carrier protein complex physically moved through the receptor lymph/mucus to interact with a
membrane bound receptor. After the membranous receptor interaction, the molecule would be deactivated and any odourant/pheromone-binding protein recycled. This new electrical chemosensory model being
proposed here has the pheromone or other odourant generating an electrical event in the extra-cellular mucus. Before the pheromone arrives, proteins of the 'carrier class' dissolved in the receptor
mucus slowly and continuously sequester ions. A sensed pheromonal chemical species sorbs to the mucus and immediately binds to the now ion-holding dissolved protein. The binding of the pheromone to
the protein causes a measurable conformational change in the pheromone/odourant-binding protein, desequestering ions. Releasing the bound ions changes the potential differences across a nearby super-
sensitive dendritic membrane resulting in dendrite excitation. Pheromones will be implicated in the aetiology of the infectious, psychiatric and autoimmune diseases. This is the third article in a

institutions of the Zapotec state emerged during this or the succeeding Monte Alban II period (100 B.C.–A.D. 200). Also unresolved has been the issue of when the three major subregions of the Oaxaca
Valley (Etla, Tlacolula, Ocotlan/Zimatlan) all became integrated into a single polity under the rule of Monte Alban, the state capital. This paper presents recent theoretical and empirical
contributions that have not yet been brought to bear on the problem of Monte Alban I. Concepts drawn from multilevel selection theory and evolutionary trend theory are utilized in an analysis of
Oaxaca Valley regional settlement pattern data. The analysis provides a multilevel context for a discussion of recent survey and excavations at San Martin Tilcajete, the results of which are
clarifying the sequence of institutional development in Oaxaca. Taken together, the regional analysis and the discoveries at Tilcajete indicate that: (1) the Zapotec state emerged during Late Monte
Alban I (300–100 B.C.) in a context of intensifying competition—including violent conflict—among rival polities within the Oaxaca Valley; and (2) even though the early Zapotec state began a campaign
of territorial expansion during Late Monte Alban I, political unification of all three major subregions of the Valley was not achieved until Monte Alban II.","Spencer, Charles S. and Redmond, Elsa M."
79,valdimarsson_is_2001,Is the level of aggression and dispersion in territorial fish dependent on light intensity?,2001-01-01,"Abstract Territory size in animals is traditionally taken to be the result of a trade-off between the spatial/temporal distribution of resources and the level of competition. However, it may also be
influenced by physical constraints that themselves show temporal variability. Thus at low light levels it becomes more difficult for visually oriented animals both to see intruders (and therefore to
defend a territory) and to locate the resource (e.g. food). This could result in a direct relationship between light intensity and territory size, with animals aggregating in preferred foraging areas
at lower light intensities. We tested this hypothesis by recording the dispersion and aggressive behaviour (behaviours normally associated with territoriality) of replicate groups of juvenile Atlantic
salmon, Salmo salar , exposed to four night-time light intensities (0.00, 0.01, 0.50 and 1.00 lx, the latter equivalent to dawn/dusk) on successive nights. There were clear effects of light intensity:
fish tolerated other individuals nearer to them and showed little aggression under conditions equivalent to starlight (0.00–0.01 lx), but both aggression rate and the distance between fish increased
markedly with light level. The fish were also most aggressive early in the night (possibly because of readjustments in territory mosaics). These results may indicate that territory size, and hence the
territorial mosaic, in salmon is dynamic, changing greatly between low and high light intensities, with fish defending much smaller territories on dark nights (rather than being nonterritorial, as
previously suggested). This has implications for population regulatory mechanisms in winter, when the fish are predominantly nocturnal.","Valdimarsson, Sveinn K. and Metcalfe, Neil B."

59,murray_are_2001,Are ecological and evolutionary theories scientific?,2001-01-01,"Scientists observe nature, search for generalizations, and provide explanations for why the world is as it is. Generalizations are of two kinds. The first are descriptive and inductive, such as
Boyle's Law. They are derived from observations and therefore refer to observables (in this case, pressure and volume). The second are often imaginative and form the axioms of a deductive theory, such
as Newton's Laws of Motion. They often refer to unobservables (e.g. inertia and gravitation). Biology has many inductive generalizations (e.g. Bergmann's Rule and ‘all cells arise from preexisting
cells’) but few, if any, recognized universal laws and virtually no deductive theory. Many biologists and philosophers of biology have agreed that predictive theory is inappropriate in biology, which
is said to be more complex than physics, and that one can have nonpredictive explanations, such as the neo‐Darwinian Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Other philosophers dismiss nonpredictive,
explanatory theories, including evolutionary ‘theory’, as metaphysics. Most biologists do not think of themselves as philosophers or give much thought to the philosophical basis of their research.
Nevertheless, their philosophy shows in the way they do research. The plethora of ad hoc (i.e. not universal) hypotheses indicates that biologists are reluctant inductivists in that the search for
generalization does not have a high priority. Biologists test their hypotheses by verification. Theoretical physicists, in contrast, are deductive unifiers and test their explanatory hypotheses by
falsification.","Murray, Bertram G."

Evolution presents an awkward picture of multilevel selection. Some chapters are excellent, but others are highly ambivalent and, in some cases, downright confused about what multilevel selection is

In this study I have monitored fish
community composition/abundance before and after a cormorant colony was established in a high productive lake, Ymsen, of south-central Sweden. Data on fish abundance before cormorant establishment
enabled me to control for changes in fish densities prior to cormorant colonisation. To control for possible changes in fish populations caused by factors other than cormorant predation (i.e. large-
scale regional changes due to climate) data were compared with a control lake, Garnsviken, with no cormorants. Since Lake Ymsen also harbour an important commercial fishery, cormorant impact upon
fishery yields was evaluated. The most important fish species in the diet of the cormorants were ruffe (75\% by number), roach (11\%) and perch (10\%). Except for perch, commercially important fish
made up a very small fraction of the cormorant diet. Eel, the most important fish for the fishery, was absent in the cormorant diet, pikeperch constituted 0.2\% and pike 1.5\%. Estimated fish outtake
by the cormorants was 12.8 kg ha -1 yr -1 compared to 8.6 kg ha -1 yr -1 for the fishery. Despite considerable fish withdrawal by the cormorants, fish populations did not seem to change in numbers or
biomass. The present study indicates that cormorant impact upon fish populations in Lake Ymsen was small and probably in no case has led to declines of neither commercial nor of non-commercial fish
species. Still, the number of breeding cormorants in Lake Ymsen, in relation to foraging area, is among the highest known for Swedish lakes.","Engström, Henri"

biologically implausible and not needed to explain the evolution of altruism anyway. But in their recent book, Elliot Sober and David Sloan Wilson [1998] argue that the widespread opposition to group
selection is founded on conceptual confusion. The theories that have been propounded as alternatives to group selection are actually group selection in disguise, they maintain. I examine their
arguments for this claim, and John Maynard Smith's arguments against it. I argue that Sober and Wilson arrive at a correct position by faulty reasoning. In the final section, I examine the issue of

per successful nest) for 20 nesting seasons. Annual nest numbers fluctuated somewhat irregularly in this period, from 1421 to 7953. Nest numbers were strongly positively associated with local and
regional rainfall in the 12 months prior to breeding, but the randomisation test also indicated a density-dependent relationship between the nest numbers of successive years. Furthermore, an upsurge
in nest numbers commenced in the relatively dry year of 1987, after the egrets started feeding on cultivated land. It is proposed that nesting numbers were largely controlled by rainfall in a density-
independent way and any density-dependent effect was undercompensatory in its influence on numbers. The change in feeding behaviour was a unique event that probably made substantially more food
available to the egrets. Annual mean breeding success ranged from 1.8 to 2.9 fledglings per pair, and was significantly greater following wetter springs. Breeding success was inversely associated with
the number nesting that season over the first 14 seasons, but in the ensuing years of prolonged drought both brood sizes and nest numbers were low.","McKilligan, Neil"
9,flux_evidence_2001,Evidence of self-limitation in wild vertebrate populations,2001-01-01,"Whether animal populations are regulated by social behaviour at levels limited by their food supplies (Lack 1954) or safely below the threat of starvation (WynneEdwards 1962) is still in dispute.
Prudent restraint (which Wynne-Edwards refers to as ""self-regulation"" or ""self-limitation"") involves a degree of altruism that he thought unlikely to evolve under individual selection, so he invoked
group selection (Wynne-Edwards 1962, 1986). The subsequent heated debate was largely defused by the recognition of kin selection and the everwidening concept of inclusive fitness (e.g. Mayr 1991, Bell
1997), and by the demonstration that at least some forms of altruism can arise under individual selection. However, the basic problem remains: does social behaviour regulate populations at, or
prudently below, their food limits? This problem needs to be examined independently of its mechanism of evolution. A comparison of the population densities attained by wild species and their feral
domesticated forms, whose social behaviour has been disrupted by long-term selection for tolerance to crowding given unrestricted food, could provide a measure of this effect of social behaviour. The
remarkably different densities attained by European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus (L.)) and brown hares (Lepus europaeus Pallas) are instructive. Rabbits often exceed densities of 100/ha, and can
reach 200/ha on productive land and fertile islands (Thompson and King 1994). They have also been recorded to overeat their food supply and starve to death in enclosures (Gibb et al. 1978), on islands
(Flux and Fullagar 1992), and on the mainland (Rolls 1969). Hares use the same grassland habitats as rabbits, and 78\% of their diets overlap (Homolka 1987); yet hare populations seldom exceed 2/ha
and the highest density ever reported, on a predator-free island with very favourable habitat, was 3.4/ha (Abildgard et al. 1972). As hares are only twice the weight of rabbits, they are obviously far
below any significant food limit. This I demonstrated to my own satisfaction by keeping three pet hares in cages and feeding them for a year on vegetation collected from a 0.2-ha field, an effective
density five times higher than any wild population has ever reached. Because rabbits and hares are important game animals, they have been introduced onto hundreds of islands, and frequently onto the
same island in turn; so these highest density figures are based on a large data set (Flux and Fullagar 1992). The mean and range of the highest biomass recorded for each species of wild lagomorph
listed by Chapman and Flux (1990) are as follows: for 12 species of Ochotona, 8.75 (0.7-38.0) kg/ha; for 14 species of Lepus, 8.96 (0.08-40.3) kg/ha; and for six species of rabbits excluding
Oryctolagus, 6.28 (0.3-18.0) kg/ha. Clearly it is the European rabbit, with peak biomass reaching 330 kg/ha, which is exceptional rather than the brown hare at 13.6 kg/ha. The anomaly can be explained
by Fitter's (1959) suggestion that the ""wild"" European rabbit was really a feral form, domesticated by monks for over 600 years, which is supported by recent DNA analyses (Thompson and King 1994).
These rabbits were liberated on more than 800 islands (Flux and Fullagar 1992) and are the stock present in Australia, New Zealand, and South America, where their catastrophic effects on agriculture
are well documented (Thompson and King 1994). A domestic animal is defined by Collins English Dictionary (1992) as one ""bred or kept by man as a pet or for purposes such as the supply of food""; and
""feral"" as ""existing in a wild state, esp. after being domestic"". A general review is outside the scope of this note, but ungulates seem to show the same pattern: feral goats on Macaulay Island, New
Zealand, reached a biomass of 300 kg/ha (King 1990), while the biomass of all large herbivores combined in 24 African wildlife areas averaged 64.6 (4.1-199) kg/ha (Coe et al. 1976). The ""classic""

deeper (and more efficient!) relationship than would otherwise be possible.Yet many commitments are not at all nice. When John F. Kennedy committed the United States to eliminating missiles from Cuba,
millions of human lives were put at risk. When a thuggish-looking man offers unrequested fire insurance to a small retail shop, the implied threat of arson may well influence the owner's behavior. In
a more banal vein, nearly everyone has waited for a repairman who never arrives. From the personal to the political to the mundane, commitments are everywhere. Threats and promises change people's
beliefs and, therefore, their actions. In a world without commitments social exchanges arise mainly from helping relatives and trading favors. In such a world individuals can reliably be expected to
act straightforwardly in their own interests. The advent of commitment changes everything. As soon as one individual finds a way to convince another that he or she will act other than in simple self-
interest, social life is transformed. Now, individuals must consider the possibility that others may fulfill promises and threats. Sometimes the situation itself makes fulfillment worthwhile , but
apparently irrational commitments also may influence others profoundly. A whole new category of social influence emerges. 2 Evolution and the Capacity for Commitment Reputations become important
predictors of behavior, and people begin spending vast amounts of effort to convince others that they will fulfill their promises and threats. One way to convince others of one's credibility in a
commitment is to give up options in order to change the incentives in a situation. Others observe that compliance is now in the person's interests, and change their expectations and behavior
accordingly. By signing a lease, for instance, a person gives up the option to leave on short notice, and induces the landlord to give up the option of raising the rent in the middle of winter. Not
all commitments, however, are backed by such tangible incentives. As Frank and Hirshleifer argue (Hirshleifer 1987; Frank 1988), people also can convince others that they will keep their promises by
emotional displays that testify to their irrationality. Such commitments give rise to profound paradoxes. In order to influence others an individual must convince people that he …","Nesse, R."

distinct types of UOSs. These UOSs do not always have a defined structural organization; they can be parts of a living organism, a cohesive group of conspecifics, a multiunit entity, a totipotent
cell, a DNA fragment, or a whole organism. UOS types diversify by amalgamation or parcelation processes of apparent entities. Therefore, previous attempts to characterize the UOSs solely on some

After 1986, the
proportion of the catch in the eastern North Sea gradually declined. It is assumed that the high catches in the eastern North Sea in the early 1980s were due to a delayed migration of the herring from
the eastern to the western part of the North Sea. This delayed departure of the herring from the eastern North Sea could have been caused by favourable food conditions in this area. Data on Calanus
finmarchicus from the Continuous Plankton Recorder show that the seasonal cycle of this copepod in the eastern North Sea was delayed during the period 1976–1984, which resulted in an prolonged food
supply for the herring in this area. It is likely that this extension of the feeding season induced the herring to delay their departures from the eastern North Sea. When the Calanus season shortened
after 1985, the herring advanced their departure from the eastern North Sea. There was a delay of one or two years between the shortening of the feeding season and the earlier departure of the herring
from the eastern North Sea. This suggests the existence of a certain conservatism in the migrations of the herring. It seems that the time of departure from the eastern North Sea is based not only on
the food situation in the current year, but also on the average timing of food production in earlier years.","Corten, A"

Since the 1960s, evolutionary
biologists have also devoted considerable attention to this issue. In the last 25 years, mathematical models (reviewed in Wilson and Sober 1994) have shown that, under particular demographic
conditions, natural selection can favor traits that benefit group members as a whole, even when the bearers of those traits experience reduced reproductive success relative to other members of their
group. This process, often referred to as ""trait group selection"" (D. S. Wilson 1975) can occur when the population consists of numerous, relatively small ""trait groups,"" defined as collections of
individuals who influence one another's fitness as a result of the trait in question. For example, consider a cooperative trait such as alarm calling, which benefits only individuals near the alarm
caller. A trait group would include all individuals whose fitness depends on whether or not a given individual gives an alarm call. If the cooperative trait confers sufficiently large reproductive
benefits on the average group member, it can spread. This is because trait groups that happen to include a large proportion of cooperators will send out many more offspring into the population as a
whole than will groups containing few, or no cooperators. Thus, even though noncooperators out reproduce cooperators within trait groups (because they experience the benefits of the presence of
cooperators without incurring the costs), this advantage can be offset by differences in rates of reproduction between trait groups. Numerous models of group selection (Wilson and Sober 1994) show
that whether cooperative traits can spread depends on the relative magnitude of fitness effects at these two levels of selection (within and between trait groups). In addition, there is a growing body
of empirical evidence for the operation of group selection in nature (e.g., Colwell 1981; Breden and Wade 1989; Bourke and Pranks 1995; Stevens et al. 1995; Seeley 1996; Miralles et al. 1997;

Although this idea is now rejected as a general mechanism,
it may apply in some species where females are damaged during courtship attempts, such as the Mediterranean tortoise Testudo hermanni. The sex ratios (adult males: adult females) of most dense Greek
populations were more extreme (over 1.5:1) than could be accounted for by the earlier age at maturity of males, and some ranged to over 6:1. The sex ratio was correlated with the population density of
adult males and the frequency of courtship attempts on females, and negatively correlated with the longevity of females. A high population density of males limits the density of adult females. This
intrinsic regulation of population size is a consequence, rather than a goal, of a particular type of courtship behaviour (persistent thrusts by the male using a tail with a sharp terminal spur) in T.
hermanni. Existing population densities at many Greek sites are probably unnaturally high, owing to the reduction of natural predators.","Hailey, A. and Willemsen, R. E."

Within this broad pattern, many variations are possible
because all traits are co-evolved with numerous others in complex ways. Clutch-size, for example, has long been understood to be frequently lower than the number of young parents are capable of
supporting by working at their top capacity, especially in long-lived species. Nevertheless, studies of species with fatal competition among nestmates have shown that parents routinely create one
offspring more than they normally will raise, as if counting on brood-reduction to trim family size after hatching. Three general and mutually compatible parental incentives for initial over-
production have been identified, with David Lack's resource-tracking hypothesis having received the most attention. Extra sibs can also assist each other in some circumstances, but a third explanation
for over-production that has been around for nearly four decades, the insurance hypothesis, has been surprisingly overlooked and, in some cases, actively challenged. It simply posits that parents
create extra offspring as back-ups for members of the core brood that chance to die very early. We propose that the skepticism over the role of insurance is misdirected, that having a back-up is
virtually automatic as a contributing incentive to parents and, in some taxa, that it provides a necessary and totally sufficient explanation for over-production. Some empirical approaches to the
study of the insurance hypothesis are reviewed, in hopes of encouraging further field study of over-production in general, because that process underlies much of the internal conflict observed in
avian families.","Forbes, Scott and Mock, Douglas W."

explanations for some of the basic patterns of variation in life-history traits among birds. In part, this reflects two consequences of the predominance of evolutionary ecology thinking during the
past three decades. First, by blurring the distinction between life-history traits and life-table variables, we have tended to divorce life histories from their environmental context, which forms the
link between the life history and the life table. Second, by emphasizing constrained evolutionary responses to selective factors, we have set aside alternative explanations for observed correlations
among life-history traits and life-table variables. Density-dependent feedback and independent evolutionary response to correlated aspects of the environment also may link traits through different
mechanisms. Additionally, in some cases we have failed to evaluate quantitatively ideas that are compelling qualitatively, ignored or explained away relevant empirical data, and neglected logical
implications of certain compelling ideas. Comparative analysis of avian life histories shows that species are distributed along a dominant slow-fast axis. Furthermore, among birds, annual reproductive
rate and adult mortality are directly proportional to each other, requiring that pre-reproductive survival is approximately constant. This further implies that age at maturity increases dramatically
with increasing adult survival rate. The significance of these correlations is obscure, particularly because survival and reproductive rates at each age include the effects of many life-history
traits. For example, reproductive rate is determined by clutch size, nesting success, season length, and nest-cycle length, each of which represents the outcome of many different interactions of an
individual's life-history traits with its environment. Resolution of the most basic issues raised by patterns of life histories clearly will require innovative empirical, modeling, and experimental
approaches. However, the most fundamental change required at this time is a broadening of the evolutionary ecology paradigm to include a variety of alternative mechanisms for generating patterns of
life-history variation.","Ricklefs, Robert E."

stochastic spatial distribution of actively moving organisms is unstable; (2) simple or complex aggregations of organisms appear as a result of active motion; and (3) the ability for active motion
ties the organisms with place. These results show that models that apply an internalist approach can considerably simplify the theory of spatial behavior of organic systems. Explanations based on the

Darwin’s solution to this problem was to argue that music
evolved by sexual selection as a courtship device to increase reproductive success. He envisioned music as functioning analogously to the courtship songs and advertisement calls of many animal
species, most of which are performed exclusively by males during a breeding season. However Darwin’s thinking predated the comparative study of world music-cultures, which developed only in the late
19th century. The 20th century anthropological study of music has been overwhelmingly group-functionalist in its thinking. Music is almost exclusively described in terms of its manifold roles in
supporting group function—with regard to both within-group cooperation and between-group competitiveness. In this essay, I criticize the sexual selection model of music and attempt to channel the
group-functionalist thinking of the ethnomusicology literature into a group selection model. Music is a powerful device for promoting group identity, cognition, coordination and catharsis, and it has
a host of design features that reflect its strong role in supporting cooperation and synchronization at the group level, features such as the capacity for pitch blending and the use of isometric
rhythms. I argue that music and group rituals co-evolved during human evolution such that ritual developed as an information system and music its reinforcement system. Music is a type of social
“reward” system, analogous to the neuromodulatory systems of the brain. This view accounts for music’s universal association to ritual activities as well as its psychologically rewarding properties.","Brown, Steven"

in this context. With the end of absolutism and feudalism and with the beginning of the industrial revolution this problem won new actuality. The answer given by classical utilitarianism was a
hedonistic one: the greatest-happiness principle (Bentham 1823). It was Marshall and Pigou (1929) who brought individual utility into economics. Social welfare was now referring to the utility derived
from the consumption of goods (marginalist view) rather than to production only. Utility was assumed to be measurable in terms of willingness to pay, and its aggregation, economic welfare, was
accepted as a good measure for total welfare as well. In so far Pigou argued for the interpersonal comparability of utility. At the beginning of the 1930s a shift occurred from the objective utility
concept of Pigou to a subjective concept supported by Robbins (1935): Hedonistic introspection was replaced by formally specified, revealed preferences. Since, as a consequence, interpersonal
comparison of utility was difficult to achieve it was necessary to rely on ordinal utilities and on the Pareto principle. While trying to widen the scope of ordinal utilitarianism by combining it with
a theory of voting Arrow (1963) arrived at his impossibility theorem and at the conclusion that there was no way to reconstruct social preferences from the individual ones as long as there was no

as recently analyzed by Sober \& D.S. Wilson. I do not take a stand on the issue of the existence of group selection. Instead, I examine the level of human altruism that could exist if group selection
were an engine of human evolution. For the Sober \& Wilson mechanism to work, groups practicing altruism must grow faster than other groups. I call altruistic behavior that would lead to faster growth
‘efficient altruism’. This often consists of cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma. ltruistic acts such as helping a temporarily hungry or injured person would qualify as efficient altruism. Efficient
altruism would also require monitoring recipients to avoid shirking. Utilitarianism would be an ethical system consistent with efficient altruism, but Marxism or the Rawlsian system would not.
Discussions of efficient altruism also help understand intuitions about fairness. We perceive those behaviors as ‘fair’ that are consistent with efficient altruism. It is important to understand that,
even if humans are selected to be altruistic, the forms of altruism that might exist must be carefully considered and ircumscribed.","Rubin, Paul H."

rightness of capitalism. But, in the great texts of that discourse, these writers downplayed a crucial requirement for capitalism's creation: for it to succeed, peasants would have to abandon their
self-sufficient lifestyle and go to work for wages in a factory. Why would they willingly do this? Clearly, they did not go willingly. As Michael Perelman shows, they were forced into the factories
with the active support of the same economists who were making theoretical claims for capitalism as a self-correcting mechanism that thrived without needing government intervention.Directly
contradicting the laissez-faire principles they claimed to espouse, these men advocated government policies that deprived the peasantry of the means for self-provision in order to coerce these small
farmers into wage labour. To show how Adam Smith and the other classical economists appear to have deliberately obscured the nature of the control of labour and how policies attacking the economic
independence of the rural peasantry were essentially conceived to foster primitive accumulation, Perelman examines diaries, letters, and the more practical writings of the classical economists.He
argues that these private and practical writings reveal the real intentions and goals of classical political economy - to separate a rural peasantry from their access to land. This rereading of the
history of classical political economy sheds important light on the rise of capitalism to its present state of world dominance. Historians of political economy and Marxist thought will find that this
book broadens their understanding of how capitalism took hold in the industrial age.","Perelman, Michael"

under investigation. The increase of altruistic behavior exhibited in these simulations is not based on reciprocal altruism, as there are no strategies conditional on other players’ past actions, nor
does it depend on kin selection via inclusive fitness, as there are no genes. This model is very general in that it can represent both biological and social non-zero sum situations in which utility
(fitness) depends upon conditions at different hierarchical levels. The two parameters of the prisoner’s dilemma in this model, which determine the gain in individual utility for defection and the
dependence of utility on collective cooperation, are respectively analogous to within-group and between-group selective forces in multilevel selection theory.","Fletcher, J. and Zwick, M."

During the late 1960s, both species declined at the time when the spawning population on Aberdeen Bank disappeared. Earlier work has demonstrated that an increased Atlantic inflow results in a
southward displacement of plankton concentrations and feeding herring in the northwestern North Sea. I hypothesize that such a southern distribution of the herring stock, caused indirectly by the
increased Atlantic inflow, influenced recruit spawners to choose the nearby Aberdeen Bank as their spawning ground in 1983. Fluctuations of the spawning populations in the northern North Sea during
earlier decades are explained by switches of recruitment between the northern and southern population, as a result of variations in latitudinal distribution of the recruiting year-class.","Corten, Ad"

and discarded fishes from commercial fisheries. This implies that discards should be a major component in fulmar diets in the more recently colonised areas in the south of their range. This paper
examines the contemporary diet of the northern fulmar at three major breeding sites, Fair Isle (Shetland, UK), Iceland and Disko Fjord (western Greenland). At Fair Isle, 89\% of regurgitates contained
fishes, with sandeels (Ammodytidae) recorded in 37\%; 32\% contained crustaceans (mainly decapods); 8\% contained squid. There was also a temporal trend; sandeels declining and crustaceans increasing
in the diet from July to August. In Iceland, fishes were also the main prey (47 to 93\% of wet mass), with sandeels common in the south and west, and capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the north and east.
Other fish species were mainly discards, and together with discarded decapods and fish offal formed 5 to 72\% of the diet, depending on the sector. Euphausiids, amphipods and copepods constituted 3 to
13\% of the diet. At Disko, 39\% of samples contained fishes, 64\% contained crustaceans (mainly amphipods), 22\% contained squid, and 16\% contained pteropods. There was a clear temporal trend, with
the bulk of the samples made up of crustaceans in mid-June, capelin from late June to late July, and crustaceans and pteropods from late July to late August. An extensive review of published studies
was also carried out. The general pattern was for birds in more southerly populations to consume more discarded fishes, fish offal and benthic invertebrates. However, a considerable proportion of
their diet also consisted of juvenile gadids, sandeels, capelin and pelagic zooplankton, which fulmars catch for themselves, and we suggest that breeding adults in the south are less dependent on
fishing waste than is generally assumed.","Phillips, R. A. and Petersen, M. K. and Lilliendahl, K. and Solmundsson, J. and Hamer, K. C. and Camphuysen, C. J. and Zonfrillo, B."

technology — in this case, to light a cigarette — and suggested that it might contain a grain of metaphoric truth (Larsen 1989, 91). This brief note pursues the suggestion (in a rather different way
from Larsen's Wonderfully anachronistic collage of stereotypes) by drawing attention to some analogies for early artefact-making which deserve more systematic consideration. It has been a feature of
recent discussions of material culture that their symbolic meanings are as important in understanding the social role of artefacts as their technical applications. This was the message of two
important contributions to-artefact studies in the years around 1980, that have served as paradigms for much subsequent reinterpretation (Hodder 1982; Frankenstein \& Rowlands 1978). A Parallel
transformation has taken place in biology, in which the role of sexual selection has come to supplement an earlier emphasis on adaptations concerned largely with food-getting (e.g. Ridley 1993). This
emphasizes the importance, of communication, especially in the context of mating-rituals and alliance-formation. Sexual selection and grooming-behaviour now play a critical role in many current Models
of early hominid behaviour (Miller 1992; Dunbar 1997; Deacon 1997). The application of these ideas, however, has been principally to the development of oral or gestural/tactile communication and
proto-linguistic capacity; and the role of artefact-use has continued to be treated principally as a technical Practice — for instance in relation to gaining access to meat. (This in itself is
important in provisioning and inter-sexual relations — as reductively expressed in the 'meat for sex' hypothesis, but also capable of subtle elaboration as in Deacon 1997,384-401.) Recognition of the
widespread occurrence of simple toolmaking practices amongst chimpanzees (and local variability in their detail, implying some form of tradition in patterns of learned behaviour) has also reduced the
formerly distinctive role assigned to artefact-creation in hominids, suggesting that the use of material objects was simply part of a spectrum of largely pre-existing manipulative behaviours, using
organic materials such as wood or grass-stems. This interpretative shift has greatly improved understanding of the kinds of processes at work in the emergence of early hominine behaviour. Nevertheless
it has tended to bypass archaeological discussion, by setting up an apparent opposition betweerf""communicative and technical behaviours, which coincides directly with the difference between
(proto)verbal and material practices in a way that may be unhelpful. This is especially unfortunate in that it also coincides with the boundaries of academic disciplines and research methodologies.
The division is reinforced by continuing use of the word 'toolmaking', which automatically privileges the technical over the expressive aspects of material culture (just as 'subsistence' offers a
reductive label for food and cuisine: Sherratt 1999b). Since material modification includes spatial displacement (creating manuports) as well as morphological alteration ('artefact production' sensu
stricto), it is important to recognise that behaviours involving material objects are not limited to the production of sharp-edged lithic elements which are archaeologically their most easily
recognizable category; and also that 'manuport' does not necessarily equate with purely technical categories such as 'pounder' or 'hammerstone'. Behaviours involving the collection and modification of
materials are not uncommon amongst animals, and are particularly notable in birds (Dawkins 1999, ch. 11). Many of these, such as nest-construction, may be thought of as purely 'technical', in that
they provide shelter essential to survival; yet even here there are elements which might be termed 'expressive' in that they play a part in communication Hetween members of the same species, and
usually of the opposite sex. The clearest and most spectacular examples of this communicative element are pro-","Sherratt, Andrew"

ideological  when applied to the human condition, with its claims for genes  “for” everything from sexual orientation to compulsive  shopping. The current enthusiasm for genetics and ultra-Darwinist
accounts, with their selfish-gene metaphors for living processes,  misunderstand both the phenomena of development and the interactive  role that DNA and the fluid genome play in the cellular

Cows in groups of four stayed closer to their nearest neighbour, moved their head more rapidly from side to side during grazing and spent more time ruminating than cows in larger groups, suggesting
that they were more vigilant against a perceived prédation risk. Cows in the group of 16 were more aggressive, maintained a greater distance to their nearest neighbour and had a faster rate of
stepping while they grazed, compared with cows in smaller groups, suggesting increased inter-cow competition. They also spent longer grooming themselves, which normally acts as a displacement activity
and may indicate increased stress. Cows in groups of eight had a faster biting rate when grazing than cows in small or large groups and they spent the longest time lying down. There were no effects of
group size on milk production but across treatment groups the high yielding cows were the first to initiate grazing and to enter the milking parlour.","Rind, M. I. and Phillips, C.J. C."

before its validity can be assessed. Of these proposed mechanisms, group selection historically has been the most controversial. Although the extent to which empirical data support group selection
hypotheses is uncertain, there is evidence for group-level selection among avirulent virus strains and foraging ant queens. Researchers studying mammalian behavior, particularly primatologists, have
largely dismissed models of group-level selection. Most discussion of altruism among primates has focused on differences in fitness among individuals within a single group, but students of altruistic
behaviors exhibited by primates also need to investigate intergroup variation with respect to these behaviors. Various altruistic behaviors are likely to have evolved through different forms of

This paper expands upon Zahavi's promising ""altruism
as a handicap"" argument, in which ""altruists"" improve their future fitness as a result of honestly signalling their phenotypic quality to prospective mates or allies. It is suggested that cooperative
systems may be especially likely to evolve signals using altruism as a handicap, because signalling costs could be recouped within the collaboration (e.g. mate choice based on courtship feeding also
increases female reproductive output). However, the claim that the altruism inherent in helping-at-thenest has evolved to enhance the ""social prestige"" of helpers within the group seems unlikely on
the basis of current evidence. The utility of the concept of social prestige is also questionable, particularly when compared to related and overlapping ideas already in use, concerning dominance,
reciprocity and affiliative behaviour. In order to generate a need for the alternative hypothesis, misleading arguments have been presented concerning the similarities between kin selection and group
selection, and the evolutionary stability of cooperation and reciprocation. This confusion seems rather unnecessary, because altruism as a signal is compatible with these other well-established
theories. Further work is now required in the form of mathematical game theory models to explore the evolutionary stability of altruism as a signal.","Wright, Jonathan"

been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection
plays in theories of social evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on
interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our model of social selection is analogous to covariance models of other forms of selection. We
observe that an opportunity for social selection exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in fitness
due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for
social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait covaries with the selective environment provided by
conspecifics. A variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic effects may contribute to the covariance of
interacting phenotypes, which promotes social selection. The independent force of social selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned empirically from the force of natural
selection (measured by the natural selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide insights into social evolution.","Wolf, Jason B. and Brodie III, Edmund D. and Moore, Allen J."
780,hawley_ontogenesis_1999,The {Ontogenesis} of {Social} {Dominance}: {A} {Strategy}-{Based} {Evolutionary} {Perspective},1999-01-01,"Abstract Social dominance results when members of a social group vary in their ability to acquire resources in the presence of others (i.e., compete). Traditional approaches to social dominance often
emphasize coercive behavior, but nonetheless suggest that dominant individuals are socially central (e.g., watched, attractive social partners). These patterns, however, apply to humans only up to a
certain age. This apparent discontinuity may give the false impression that social dominance is less relevant to human social organization than it is to animal social organization. This paper
reintroduces the ethological concept of social dominance, but reinterprets it from a strategy-based perspective. That is, if social dominance is defined as differential ability to control
resources—without reference to how this is done—then children evidently employ different strategies to compete with peers (e.g., coercive and prosocial). Furthermore, the type of strategy children
employ and peers' responses to it depend largely on the ages of the children. By adopting a strategy-based approach to social dominance and explicitly incorporating developmental processes and
uniquely human capacities, human social dominance patterns appear to be more similar to primate patterns than commonly believed. Implications for social competence, peer relationships, and the
development of the self are discussed.","Hawley, Patricia H."

effects of mutation and migration on the stability of the altruistic demes, which are the only stable demes in the absence of these processes. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between the proposed

First, comparisons in evolutionary performance are made between simulations of unicellular organisms and very simple multicellular-like organisms, under varying conditions. The results show that such
multicellularity without differentiation appears selectively neutral, but that differentiation to soma (nonreproductives) proves beneficial as the amount of epistasis in the fitness landscape
increases. This is explained by considering mutations in the generation of daughter cells and their subsequent effect on the propagule's fitness. This is interpreted as a simple example of the Baldwin
effect. Second, the correspondences between multicellularity and eusociality are highlighted, particularly that both contain individuals who do not reproduce. The same process is then used to explain
the emergence of eusocial colonies.","Bull, Larry"

arguments for group selection, and Hamilton's explantation of social behaviour in terms of the inclusive fitness of individuals. Hamilton's approach differs from the gene-centred approach pioneered by
Williams and Dawkins, although both the problem and its solution are essentially the same. The choice of approach depends on conceptual and mathematical simplicity, and on one's attitude to the causal
efficacy of genes. The problem of selection on units above the species level is discussed. Today, we are in the main concerned with cases in which selection acts simultaneously at two levels. This is
true of current research on intragenomic conflict and of the suggestion by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry that in the major transitions in evolution, entities that were capable of independent replication
before the transition can only replicate as part of a larger whole after it.","Lewontin, R. C."
15,grafen_fertility_1998,Fertility and {Labour} {Supply} {inFemina} economica,1998-01-01,"This paper sets out a formal framework for the biological-evolutionary study of human economic behaviour. Femina economica is a hypothetical parthenogenetic species with a simple economy. Individuals
make decisions about labour supply and fertility subject to time and resource constraints. Labour is of differing types and a parent determines the type of her offspring's labour. Wages are determined
as marginal productivities from an economy-wide production function. Three propositions are proved, of which the first shows that under very general conditions there exists a population genetic
equilibrium, in which individuals' decisions are assumed to be under genetic control. The second shows that at a population genetic equilibrium, individuals have the same behaviour as they would at an
economic equilibrium, in which individuals are assumed to maximise a common utility function. The third proposition shows that if the common utility function fulfils certain conditions, the attainment
of an economic equilibrium brings about the same behaviour as a population genetic equilibrium. This suggests a way in which evolutionarily stable behaviour can be brought about without the necessity
for changes in gene frequencies. Demographic implications include the possibility of interpreting in Darwinian terms the reductions in offspring number that occur in fertility transitions, and the
weak or even negative correlation in economically developed societies between control of resources and offspring number. There are implications for economics of deriving utility maximisation from
population genetics.","Grafen, Alan"

logical, semantic, and synthetic. Logical naturalists defend the naturalist claim with an appeal to the validity of the logical progression from premises without moral terms to conclusions with them.
Semantic naturalists defend it with an appeal to an analytical equivalence between certain nonmoral and moral expressions. Both of these approaches have been thoroughly criticised in this century.
Relatively recently, naturalists have begun to defend their naturalist thesis not from either of these perspectives, but with a direct appeal to synthetic facts which can be employed or referred to in
scientific explanations. Effective critique of naturalist theories of this newer type involves examination of both the scientific and the ethical claims made. One such synthetic naturalist approach to
ethics is the evolutionary naturalism proposed by Michael Ruse. Critique based on a thorough examination of both the science of sociobiology and the moral philosophy involved in Ruse's theory yields
informative conclusions, rendering his theory implausible from both perspectives. In light of this case study, a general strategy of argument can be developed which has potential for critique of other
naturalistic ethical theories as well. This strategy is the Argument from Moral Experience, which operates by comparing descriptive claims regarding the fundamental nature of morality that are
presented or implied by ethical theories, with the fundamental nature of morality as it is actually experienced. If arguments of this type are sound, they can be used in an exploration of whether or
not naturalism is an appropriate perspective for morality to be understood and explained properly.","Lahti, D."

One
thousand and thirteen fur seals (565 males and 448 females) were measured in a longitudinal study and an additional 2697 animals were measured at birth. At birth, female pups were about 10\% lighter
and about 3\% shorter than male pups. The coefficients of variation of mass (12.5 and 12.8\%) and length (4.5 and 4.7\%) were similar for the two sexes. We partitioned the lactation period into four
time periods: 1, the perinatal period (ages 0-10 days); 2, the early development period (ages 11-40 days); 3, the period of intensive molting (ages 41-80 days); and 4, the preweaning period (ages
81-140 days). We investigated four measures of growth: absolute growth in mass (AGM) in grams per day, absolute growth in length (AGL) in millimetres per day, relative growth in mass (RGM) as a
percentage per day, and relative growth in length (RGL) as a percentage per day. For both sexes, AGM was highest during period 4 (mean = 124.8 g/day, SE = 7.4 g/day, and mean = 109.6 g/day, SE = 6.8
g/day for males and females, respectively) and AGL was highest during period 2 (mean = 3.74 mm/day, SE = 0.18 mm/day, and mean = 3.42 mm/day, SE = 0.21 mm/day for males and females, respectively). RGM

data over periods 1-3. Sexual differences in AGL were detected for the combined data over periods 1, 3, and 4 only. No sexual differences in relative growth were found. Subsequent growth in mass and
length was correlated with birth size. We found the greatest annual variation during the periods when growth was fastest. Condition indices were calculated using the allometric relationship between
length and mass separately for neonates and pups older than 5 days. The condition indices at birth varied significantly annually. The condition index was lowest during the molting period (3). Animals
that survived for at least 40 days were larger at birth and had a higher condition index than those that did not survive. In years of moderate or high pup survival rates, survival rates were higher in
animals born later in the breeding season.","Boltnev, Alexander I and York, Anne E and Antonelis, George A"

field. Although crows in PRAs in fields commonly foraged, in previous studies crow PRAs have been found in the area at sites where little foraging probably took place, such as large rooftops. As the
evening progressed, individuals shifted to PRA sites closer to the location of night roosts. Crows left PRAs for night roosts in a highly aggregated fashion, but prior to arriving at a night roost,
individuals often separated from those with whom they left the PRA. Those individuals that were still together upon arriving at the night roost rarely settled next to each other. This pattern of
behavior, along with characteristics of crow night roosts, is inconsistent with functional explanations based on crow PRAs being information centers for location of either daytime foraging areas or
night roosts, nor does it support hypotheses solely related to foraging benefits. Rather, the results suggest that while crow PRAs are probably associated with multiple benefits, lowering predation

their ranchette neighbors resolve problems of fencing and animal trespass. Both Coase and Ellickson rely on rational actor models of Economic Man in predicting and explaining human behavior and
dispute resolution. Both offer animal trespasses as the prime illustrations. Both models are flawed. Ellickson asked what might one learn by mining historical sources to reconstruct ""bargaining""
between ranchers and farmers, but he found the task daunting. In the course of research into the ""high"" (formal) legal cultures and the ""low"" (informal) legal cultures in the lands of the British
diaspora. 1630-1910, I gathered information on just such interactions (over fencing and animal trespass), and in this article I put Coase's and Ellickson's models to the test of the historian's
laboratory. While Ellickson's model has significant power in predicting the behavior of mature British settlements where the neighbors were of the same core culture, it is not as effective in
predicting dispute resolutions in frontier conditions and is of little use in predicting the interactions of Puritans and Algonquins, Pakehas and Maoris. In 1837 a Maori Bay of Islands chief asked
missionary Samuel Marsden to ""give us a Law"" on a number of disputes common to Maori runangas (dispute settlement forums). He described four such issues. Fighting, adultery, and master-slave relations
were three of these, but the first mentioned, and the one the chief devoted the most attention to, was the problem of trespassing pigs. ""My Law is . . . that the Man who kills Pigs for trespassing on
his Plantation, having neglected to fence, had rather pay for the Pigs so killed. . . Fenced Cultivations, when trespassed on, should be paid for"" (Ward 1973:27, 50).1 That, in any event, was the way
Marsden represented this Bay of Islands chiefs views of Maori law regarding animal trespasses. On the face of it, this rule does not seem terribly different from English law. But some of the other
Maori and English rules regarding animal trespasses and fencing differed sharply, and these differences amounted to what economists call high transaction costs. Could they have prevented the two
cultures from reaching the sorts of ""rational"" agreements that members of the same culture often managed when faced with legal rules inconsistent with their mutual interests? The enumerating of animal
trespass disputes as a leading cause of disputes by Marsden's Maori chief might be attributable to differences between Maori culture and that of the British settlers. But that remains to be seen. So
does the answer to a related question: How uncommon were disputes over animal trespasses among participants in the British diaspora themselves-that is, among settler neighbors in North America and the
Antipodes who shared the same ""high"" (formal) and ""low"" (informal) legal cultures during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries? These questions do not seem to possess any obvious significance, however
intrinsically interesting they might be, but they have become so because of the way that animal trespass law and human behavior have been linked by Law \& Economics analysts. So we begin with a
consideration of what these analysts have had to say. The Law \& Economics Model: Coase, Ellickson, and Cattle in the Corn Animal trespass disputes were, and still are, generally settled ""out of
court,"" according to customary norms (what I call ""low"" legal culture here), rather than by the formal letter of the law. Legislatures, municipal councils, and courts (creators of ""high"" legal
culture) have decided what ""the law"" with regard to animal trespasses is, but the ways that people have resolved disputes over such trespasses have often not corresponded to the letter of that law. …","Karsten, Peter"

acquisition and distribution during our evolutionary past, in the so-called environment of evolutionary adaptedness.5–7 The cognitive skills required for cooperative hunting, such as cheater and
cooperator detectors,8 and especially the accounting required for fitnessenhancing harvesting, distribution, and consumption (e.g., time discounting9), are reflected in behaviors we exhibit today. Our
evolved psychological disposition to respond economically is likely derived from past ecological relationships with the beasts our hominid ancestors preyed on and the organisms that preyed on
hominids. It is not hard to imagine that many human social and political institutions have developed as solutions to complex economic production and distribution problems.10 Thus, it not surprising
that human evolutionary ecology borrows from economic theory9,11–15 and, increasingly, vice versa.16–20 It is in this context that the topic of resource conservation has been the focus of theoretical

variability. In honeybees this is enhanced through the highly polyandrous mating system which allows for wide genotypic variance and the presence of genetic specialists. Although both individual and

gestating sows housed in dynamic groups in a straw yard and fed by electronic sow feeders (ESF). Comparison of production figures from the Seale-Hayne herd with those nationally confirmed its status
as a typical commercial unit. In an initial series of investigations, detailed ethograms were compiled to describe the animals' repertoire of activities and interactions. Lying and straw manipulation
were found to be the predominant behaviours and attacks directed towards the head were the most commonly performed type of interaction. Although there was little evidence of aggressive behaviour, most
interactions were found to occur in areas where there was an obvious source of competition, namely the feeding and lying areas. A recording scale was devised to assess the level of skin damage arising
from aggressive interactions. Whilst data revealed a relationship between parity and the extent of injury, both the frequency and intensity of injury were found to be low for all animals and there was
very little evidence of vulva biting, commonly cited as a major criticism of group-housing systems. Animals were observed to rest predominantly in the lying area. There was an association between
parity and resting location, with older animals occupying those areas perceived to be more favourable. Recently introduced gilts and sows were observed to integrate gradually with the main group. An
argument is put forward for the existence of sub-groups based upon parity within the main group, although it was concluded that it was difficult to prove such a theory. A series of voluntary feed
intake (VFI) trials revealed that the animals' feeding motivation was not satisfied by the allowance fed in gestation. Results from a trial when animals were offered a high fibre, low energy diet in
comparison with their conventional feed suggested that the animals had a requirement for a certain level of energy and were not motivated simply by a desire for gut-fill. However, a subsequent
investigation into the animals feeding behaviour did not reveal any evidence of a frustrated feeding motivation; there was little evidence of nonfeeding visits and few animals were recorded in the
feed queue throughout the day. It is concluded that sows can be group-housed in a dynamic system on a restricted feed intake without detriment to their welfare or productivity status. A number
offactors were found to be critical to the success of such a system including the freedom for animals to behave as individuals, the regular provision of fresh straw and adequate space for newly
introduced animals to integrate gradually with the herd.","Hodgkiss, N."

The biological literature on communication is first
reviewed: central concepts such as the handicap principle and the view of signalling as manipulation are discussed. The equation of “biological function” with “adaptive value” is then defended, along
with a workable definition of communication. Evolutionary simulation models are advocated as a way of testing the coherence of a given theory. Contra some ALife enthusiasts, simulations are not
alternate worlds worthy of independent study; in fact they fit naturally into a Quinean picture of scientific knowledge as a web of modifiable propositions. Existing simulation work on the evolution
of communication is reviewed: much of it consists of simple proofs of concept that fail to make connections with existing theory. A particular model (MacLennan \& Burghardt, 1994) of the evolution of
referential communication in a co-operative context is replicated and critiqued in detail. Evolutionary simulations are then presented that cover a range of ecological scenarios; the first is a
general model of food- and alarm-calling. In such situations signallers and receivers can have common or conflicting interests; the model allows us to test the idea that a conflict of interests will
lead to an arms race of ever more costly signals, whereas common interests will result in signals that are as cheap as possible. The second model is concerned with communication during aggressive
interactions. Many animals use signals to settle contests, thus avoiding the costs associated with fighting. Conventional game-theoretic results suggest that the signalling of aggression or of
strength will not be evolutionarily stable unless it is physically unfakeable, but some recent models imply that cost-free, arbitrary signals can be reliable indicators of both intent and ability. The
simulation, which features continuous-time perception of the opponent’s strategy, is an attempt to settle the question. The third model deals with sexual signalling, i.e., elaborate displays that are
designed to persuade members of the opposite sex to mate. The results clarify the question of whether such displays are the pointless result of runaway sexual selection, or whether they function as
honest and costly indicators of genetic quality. The models predict the evolution of reliable communication in a surprisingly narrow range of circumstances; a serious gap remains between these
predictions and the ethological data. Future directions for simulation work are discussed.","Noble, J."

biology because a trait that limits the duration of life, including the fertile period, has a negative impact on Darwinian fitness. Current theory suggests that senescence occurs because the force of
natural selection declines with age and because longevity is only acquired at some metabolic cost. In effect, organisms may trade late survival for enhanced reproductive investments in earlier life.
The comparative study of ageing supports the general evolutionary theory and reveals that human senescence, while broadly similar to senescence in other mammalian species, has distinct features, such
as menopause, that may derive from the interplay of biological and social evolution.","Kirkwood, T. B. L."

Another major theme is the evolution of
altruistic behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self. These themes are often assumed to be strongly linked, such that altruism is required for group‐level adaptation. Multilevel selection
theory reveals a more complex relationship between the themes of altruism and organism. Adaptation at every level of the biological hierarchy requires a corresponding process of natural selection,
which includes the fundamental ingredients of phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. These ingredients can exist for many kinds of groups and do not require the extreme genetic
variation among groups that is usually associated with the evolution of altruism. Thus, it is reasonable to expect higher‐level units to evolve into adaptive units with respect to specific traits,
even when their members are not genealogically related and do not behave in ways that are obviously altruistic. As one example, the concept of a group mind, which has been well documented in the
social insects, may be applicable to other species.","Wilson, David Sloan"

0,siller_strategically_1997,Strategically developed phenotypes and the evolution of signals,1997-01-01,"In the first part of this thesis, a general one dimensional theory of strategically determined phenotypes is developed and applied to biological signalling games. Abstract modular modelling techniques
are utilised to solve hitherto analytically intractable problems including error-prone signalling, and how to incorporate genetic features into optimization models. Links are drawn between previous
biological models, such as the War of Attrition and Strategic Handicap mod- els. Mistakes in previous biological models are recognised and, where possible, rectified. A number of novel insights into
biological phenomena arising from the models are presented, including analyses of: when free signals are possible; honest signalling of future paternal investment; dimorphic signals; the effects of
the mechanisms of female discrimination in sexual selection on male signalling strategies; and the effects of relatedness on the magnitude and stability of equi- librium signalling strategies. It is
argued that Zahavi's proposed demarcation between signal selection and natural selection is unjustifiable from a theoretical perspective. The second part of the thesis concerns the epistatic handicap
process of sex- ual selection. Unlike the conditional and revealing handicap mechanisms, the epistatic or 'Zahavian' handicap mechanism of sexual selection has hitherto found scant support in the
theoretical literature, as it appeared to function only under the most extreme conditions. A continuous game theory model, a quantitative genetics model, and a three locus major gene model are
presented which show that the epistatic handicap mechanism can function, independent of the Fisher process of sexual selection, under reasonable assumptions. More- over, the game theory model
illuminates the connection between the strategic and epistatic handicap mechanisms. The quantitative genetics and major gene models, together with a fourth model, are also used to show that a general
argu- ment concerning indirect genetic correlations, which has appeared in a number of papers on sexual selection, is specious. Finally, a general theorem on games that satisfy the single-crossing
condition (also known as the sorting, Spence-Mirrless, or constant sign condition) which underlies many of the results presented in the first part of the thesis is proven in appendix C. Applying a
limit result to this general theorem provides a new proof of, and extensions to, Nash's existence result for equilibria to strategic- form games without having to resort to Kakutani's fixed point
theorem.","Siller, S."

make decisions about labour supply and fertility subject to time and resource constraints. Labour is of differing types and a parent determines the type of her offspring’s labour. Wages are determined
as marginal productivities from an economy-wide production function. Three propositions are proved, of which the first shows that under very general conditions there exists a population genetic
equilibrium, in which individuals’ decisions are assumed to be under genetic control. The second shows that at a population genetic equilibrium, individuals have the same behaviour as they would at an
economic equilibrium, in which individuals are assumed to maximise a common utility function. The third proposition shows that if the common utility function fulfils certain conditions, the attainment
of an economic equilibrium brings about the same behaviour as a population genetic equilibrium. This suggests a way in which evolutionarily stable behaviour can be brought about without the necessity
for changes in gene frequencies. Demographic implications include the possibility of interpreting in Darwinian terms the reductions in offspring number that occur in fertility transitions, and the
weak or even negative correlation in economically developed societies between control of resources and offspring number. There are implications for economics of deriving utility maximisation from
population genetics. 7 1998 Academic Press","G, A."

groups do not over-exploit their resource base. The “central function” of territoriality in birds and other higher animals is “of limiting the numbers of occupants per unit area of habitat” (1986, 6).
Species with dominance hierarchies, species with lekking breeding systems, and species with communal breeding regulate their populations. These social mechanisms have population regulation as their
“underlying primary function” (1986, 9). Wynne-Edwards argued that these mechanisms evolve through group selection. Populations without such mechanisms are apt to go extinct by eroding their own

1,mogie_malthus_1996,{MALTHUS} {AND} {DARWIN}: {WORLD} {VIEWS} {APART},1996-01-01,"There is an ongoing debate about the role that TAalthusianism played in the development of Darwin's views of nature. At one extreme is the claim that Darwin's evolutionism is a projection onto the
whole of life of Malthus' socioeconomic theory. The validity of this claim is questioned. It is pointed out that whereas Malthusianism and Darwinism share the Enlightenment secularist view that an
understanding of the needs of and pressures on, the individual is an essential preliminary to understanding supraindividual phenomena (populations, societies, etc.), fundamental differences separate
them. In particular, Malthus' social theory is rooted in metaphysics and places the common good before the selfinterest of the individual, whereas Darwin's evolutionism is a scientific theory that
proposes that self-interest will dominate the evolutionary process. Predictions that the rate of growth of the human population will catapult humankind into an ecological crisis were made as early as
the second century AD, when the theologian Tertullian warned that ""The final evidence of the fecundity of mankind is that we have grown burdensome to the world: the elements scarcely suffice for our
support, our needs grow more acute, our complaints more universal, since nature no longer provides us sustenance. In truth, pestilence and famine and wars and earthquakes must be looked upon as a
remedy for nations, a means of pruning the overgrowth of the human race."" (Quoted from Lovejoy 1948, pp. 321-322). Malthus was to repeat this warning some 1600 yr later in the Essay on the Principle
of Population, first published in 1798. The Essay provides an outline of, and background to socioeconomic arguments that were to help shape economic and social policy in Britain throughout much of the
19th century. It contains two arguments that were to play a central role in Darwinian evolutionary theory: a species produces more individuals than can be sustained; this results in a struggle for
existence. Such similarities between Malthusianism and Darwinism, together with Darwin's (1859, p. 117) description of the struggle for existence in nature as "". . . the doctrine of Malthus applied
with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms: . . ."" have given rise to claims that Darwinism is a reflection of Malthusianism. For example, Lewontin (1993, p. 10) claims that ""What
Darwin did was take early-nineteenth-century political economy and expand it to include all of natural economy."" Similarly, Desmond and Moore (1991, pp. 275-276,413-414) describe how ""Darwin's new way
of viewing nature .... kept faith with the competitive, capitalist, Malthusian dynamics of a poorlaw society,"" that his theory "". . . made Nature an ally of the middle-classes."" And Ho (1983, p. 15)
contends that what Darwin offered was "". . . an imagery of reality, gleaned from the perspective of the ruling classes, {\textbar}whichl was projected back, via a scientific theory onto reality
itself. . ."" There is little doubt that Darwin gained important insights from Malthus, most notably, that populations typically produce more individuals than can be supported (Desmond and Moore 1991,
p. 264). But it will be argued that this does not justify the description of Darwin's evolutionism as somehow an expansion or projection of Malthusianism. Such descriptors imply that the fundamental
assumptions underlying Malthusianism are recognizable within Darwinism, that Darwin incorporated not only Malthusian arguments but key elements of the Malthusian worldview. That this is not the case
will be demonstrated both by projecting Malthusian arguments onto nature and by examining the assumptions that underlie these arguments. Malthus (1798) argued that, in the absence of reproductive
restraint, a population would increase in size at a rate faster than that of the resources needed to maintain it. He urged that the well-being of humankind could best be safeguarded by individuals
desisting from reproduction if they were not able to sustain the resulting offspring without assistance. This would ensure that supply met demand. Anything that opposed this principle, especially the
Poor Laws (which imposed taxes and rates for the support of the destitute), had to be resisted. Malthus argued that resistance was necessary because assistance had repercussions other than a
redistribution of resources from resource-rich to resource-poor segments of society. In particular, the availability of assistance would persuade the poor to produce more children than they would
otherwise produce, but it would not result in the production of the extra resources needed to support them. Thus, he proposed that the right to assistance, and therefore the Poor Laws, should be
abolished, although assistance should be offered to those who, through no fault of their own, were destitute. However, the undeserving poor-who had deliberately impoverished themselves by having large
families or through indolence-were to be abandoned by society. Malthus also proposed that taxes should be raised to educate the poor in the consequences of having large families, in the expectation
that this would persuade them from doing so, thereby maintaining their status as valued members of society. A nature operating under Malthusian restraint would operate for the good of the species. To
this end, resources would be shared during periods of shortage to help ensure that valued individuals survived the shortage. Individuals who were not valued would be abandoned, but only if, and after,
they had failed to accrue value by responding positively to the effort expended by their conspecifics on them. Within the","Mogie, Michael"

In crested
penguins (Eudyptes spp.), second-laid eggs typically hatch before first-laid eggs, but the mechanisms behind this reversal are unknown. Through a multifactor field experiment with rockhopper penguins
(Eudyptes chrysocome Forster 1781), I examined several factors that might influence incubation length : laying order (smaller first-laid eggs vs. larger second-laid eggs) ; incubation onset (exposure
to immediate vs. delayed incubation) ; intraclutch dimorphism (incubated with an equal-sized vs. larger nest mate) ; laying date ; egg mass ; and egg composition (yolk and albumen content). Three of
these factors - laying order, intraclutch dimorphism and laying date-contributed significantly to variation in incubation length ; first-laid eggs produced early in the season and incubated with a
larger nest mate took longest to hatch. Differences in incubation onset did not contribute to incubation length when tested independently. The albumen content of both first and second eggs increased
in proportion to fresh egg mass, but egg mass had no effect on incubation length. Although Eudyptes parents can potentially adjust the degree of hatching asynchrony through variation in egg position,
the effects of laying date and laying order are probably beyond facultative control. Together, these effects may contribute to the unique reversal in both hatching asynchrony and egg-size dimorphism
characteristic of crested penguins.","Clair, Colleen Cassady St."

flock after breeding (FF group) and half were visually isolated from other ducks in individual pens (IF group). There was no difference in date of last incubation between the two treatment groups

is stimulated by early-molting female ducks that induce other flock members to initiate wing molt. The resultant early, synchronous wing molt among members of postbreeding flocks may provide survival
advantages by reducing the likelihood of predation on flightless ducks and allowing more time to prepare for fall migration.","Leafloor, James O. and Risi, Kenneth W. and Ankney, C. Davison"

Habitat selection may be quantified in models and
combined with hydraulic models to evaluate instream habitat suitability. Fish occupancy of habitat depends on the fish species and size. Brown trout prefer deep stream areas with moderate to low water
velocities and rocky substrates, whereas young Atlantic salmon chose more fast flowing and often shallower areas. Habitat selection has been quantified in static selection models which should be based
on measures of habitat usage and availability (preferences) and combined with data on hydro-physical conditions to build predictive habitat hydraulic models. Such models assess habitat availability
and capacity rather than discharge–biomass relationships. Limitations of static models in fish habitat studies are (1) the relevant hydro-physical variables are not included, (2) the interaction terms
are difficult to quantify and not incorporated, (3) the hydraulic models may not operate on a spatial scale that is relevant to fish, (4) the models include spatial but only to a limited extent
temporal heterogeneity in habitat conditions and (5) biotic factors are not included. Streams may be extremely heterogeneous ecosystems, both spatially and temporally, which may influence habitat
selection and modelling. In response to varying habitat availabilities (stream size and structure, water flows) habitat selection in brown trout and young Atlantic salmon is dynamic and relatively
flexible. Furthermore, changes in temperature may result in seasonal and daily niche shifts. Therefore unless the dynamic aspects of habitat selection are incorporated into the habitat models, long-
term predictive power in habitat–hydraulic modelling is unlikely. However, habitat–hydraulic modelling is a useful tool in a ‘no net loss of habitat’ management strategy regardless of these
shortcomings.","Heggenes, Jan"

fluctuations are cyclic in all three species, cycles most frequently displaying six-yr periodicity. A model acknowledging long-term trend and incorporating linear combination of sine and cosine

Optimizing strategies are used to maximize fitness in association with
creature comforts. The fertility outcome under this scheme is the production of two children. A quasi-equilibrium is re-established after the adjustment to the impacts from technological innovations
plagues wars and other events. There is evidence of little growth in population size until the onset of industrialization. The trend until industrialization was for surviving female reproduction of
slightly more than two offspring due to according some scholars individual regulation for the ""good of society"" but this view is discredited by biologists and demographers. Other explanations refer to
established living standards available resources and the technical ability to extract resources from the environment. The balance shifted when productivity outpaced population growth. Charles Darwin
contributed to the counter explanation that when population outpaces resources population stability is characteristic of all species. Modern evolutionary theory allows for planning the success of
future generations. The constraints are scarcity of sustenance resources variable limitations on survival and the need for creature comforts. Life history further specifies behavioral physiological
and anatomical factors. Biologic studies predict individual fitness in a population with high mortality benefits most from early reproduction a large number of offspring and smaller offspring who are
energy-economic. Human fertility regulation is consciously or unconsciously provided by a reproductive psychology evolved through natural selection. Mortality characteristics are internalized by
reaching puberty and sexual activity earlier engaging in shorter and less stable pair bonds and investing in fewer children.","Carey, Arlen D. and Lopreato, Joseph"

These species are closely related
and appear to occupy very similar ecological niches, only in different regions. Using a multifaceted approach, this study attempts to explain the ecology of this species complex. AI! three species
show similar physiological responses to temperature extremes, and are therefore unlikely to be directly limited by environmental temperature. However, their distributions are highly correlated to a
complex of environmental variables, particularly winter minimum temperatures, the coefficient of variation in mean annual rainfall, and the seasonality of rainfall. This combination of environmental
parameters can be used to predict the distributions of at least one of the species, P. nigricans, accurately. An analysis of the vocalizations and behaviour of the three species revealed that, whilst
P. capensis has a number of recognizably different vocalizations, those of P. barbatus and P. nigricans are very similar. The three have nearly identical behaviours, particularly courtship and pre-
copulatory behaviours. The mate recognition systems of the three are therefore extremely similar. P. barbatus is territorial during the breeding season, and exhibits highly structured-variation in
male territorial song at the level of the local neighbourhood. The literature pertaining to song dialects is reviewed, and a new hypothesis is postulated to explain song-matching in terms of
neighbour/stranger discrimination and the possible existence of cooperative territory defence. A survey of the eastern Cape region, where all three species come into contact, showed that extensive
hybridization is taking place between each species pair. Phenotypically, this hybridization is restricted to narrow hybrid zones, that are considered to be stable in both time and place. The
evolutionary and ecological significance of these zones to the distributions of the species is discussed, and it is proposed that the zones are maintained by selection acting on differentially-adapted
genomes along an environmental gradient.","Lloyd, P."
7,stidd_is_1995,Is species selection dependent upon emergent characters?,1995-01-01,"The architects of punctuated equilibrium and species selection as well as more recent workers (Vrba) have narrowed the original formulation of species selection and made it dependent upon so-called
emergent characters. One criticism of this narrow version is the dearth of emergent characters with a consequent diminution in the robustness of species selection as an important evolutionary process.
We argue that monomorphic species characters may at times be the focus of selection and that under these circumstances selection at the organism level is by-passed due to the absence of critical
variance. Selection therefore shifts to the species level where variability reemerges in a clade. The absence of critical variance among organisms prevents effect macroevolution from operating. If
species-wide properties are important in macroevolutionary processes, as we contend, systematists should pay more attention to their elucidation.","Stidd, Benton M. and Wade, David L."

12,nesse_why_1994,Why is group selection such a problem?,1994-01-01,"The controversy over group selection persists not, as Wilson \& Sober argue, because biologists do not understand the hierarchy of vehicles of selection, but because we lack criteria to determine
whether or not a trait arises from group selection, and have a deep wish to find a biological basis for our human moral feelings. Group selection? Still? More? Again? Despite dozens of articles and
books on the topic, fundamental disagreements persist. Such intractability usually arises from failure to conceptualize a problem clearly, lack of data, or the influence of political or emotional
factors. In the curious case of group selection, all three factors conspire to maintain confusion. Wilson \& Sober (W \& S) claim that ""overextended definitions of individual and gene selection have
misled a generation of biologists into thinking that natural selection almost never occurs at the level of groups"" (sect. 1.6) and they set out to ""rebuild inclusive fitness theory on the foundation
of vehicles"" (sect. 1.5). They go to great lengths to show that groups, like individuals, can be vehicles for natural selection. But this is not at issue, is it? Wilson and others have described
models in which genes that benefit a group can be selected for even though they decrease an individual's inclusive fitness. These models work, albeit under very restricted conditions. The question is
not whether traits that benefit the group at the expense of the individual are possible; the question is whether they are important, and especially whether they can account for human altruism. This
brings us to the paucity of data. The authors use starving rabbits on tiny islands to illustrate the principle, but the lack of evidence for such population limitation is the very spark that kindled
the demise of naive group selection. The aberrations from equal sex ratios Eire intriguing, but no mention is made of alternative explanations for these findings. The Hutterite example, although
atypical for the species, proves that humans can be extraordinarily altruistic, but it says nothing about the mechanisms that make this possible, and nothing about the selection processes that shape
these mechanisms. W \& S address the core question of whether organisms (especially humans) have traits (especially altruism) that were shaped by the force of selection acting at the group level
despite selection against these traits at the individual level. The conceptual problem here seems to me to have little to do with vehicles and everything to do with standards of evidence. How can we
tell if a trait arose by this process or some other one? We can not. There is no phylogeny to trace, no comparative information to guide us. If someone could demonstrate a trait that decreased
inclusive fitness and increased group fitness, we would have a good start, but I know of no such trait. As for George Williams, he may have led us out of the wilderness of naive group selectionism,
but I doubt that he would endorse the Commandment offered in his name: ""Thou shalt not apply the adaptationist program above the level of the individual."" Instead, he simply applies Ockham's razor and
insists that we explain phenomena at the simplest possible level. He also insists that we carefully distinguish the information (the codex) that is changed by natural selection from the material
domains in which that information resides. He notes that, ""a gene is not a DNA molecule; it is the transcribable information coded by the molecule . . . a whole addictive organism . . . is not really
an object, it is a region in which certain processes take place"" (Williams 1992, p. 11). He is well aware that selection can take place at levels other than the genes and the individual. His 1992 book

ability of pest populations to rapidly adapt to simplistic man-induced selection pressures has become increasingly apparent, as have the detrimental impacts of pesticides on the environment. The
evolution of the integrated pest management paradigm can be traced to these concerns, and it is now accepted that sustainable solutions to the management of pest populations will only be borne out of
ap increased understanding of the functioning of ecosystems. Knowledge of the population dynamics, and underlying causes of density changes in pest populations, behavioural ecology, and population
genetics of pests and natural enemies, are essential elements for designing appropriate biologically intensive strategies for pest management. Progress is being made, and several examples of
innovative strategies and promising areas of research, are discussed. Future work must continue to be based on a solid foundation of ecological understanding, to avoid the pitfalls of simple

suggests: (1) that contemporary sociocultural science has much to contribute to the development of a general theory of social behavior, (2) that theory refinement in the sociocultural sciences can be
enhanced significantly by reference to general principles (specifically, an amended version of the “maximization principle”) developed in recent years in the evolutionary behavioral sciences; and (3)

It is argued that this perspective is a result of an imprecise operational definition
of conservation. Conservation is defined here in contrast to the predictions of foraging theory, which assumes that foragers will behave to maximize their short-term harvesting rate. A behavior is
deemed conservation when a short-term cost is paid by the resource harvester in exchange for long-term benefits in the form of sustainable harvests. An example of the usefulness of such an operational
definition is presented using data on patch and prey choice decisions of a group of subsistence hunters, the Piro of Amazonian Peru. Results indicate that the area around the Piro village is depleted
of prey, and that hunters allocate more time to patches where return rates are highest. This response is consistent with both a conservation strategy and foraging theory. Contrary to the expectation
of the conservation strategy, however, hunters do not restrain from pursing opportunistically encountered prey in the depleted areas. The implications for conservation policy are briefly discussed.","Alvard, Michael S."

individuals are greater on average than the net benefits associated with other hereditarily distinct alternatives. That this idea focuses on the repro­ ductive consequences for individuals (not for
the species as a whole) reflects the demise of the group selectionist thinking (103) that had been adopted informally by entire generations of biologists before the mid 1960s. The emphasis on the
individual stems from recognition that natural selection should tend to eliminate all attributes that decrease individual reproductive success (relative to competing traits), no matter how useful

the welfare of the group have always been important. Human like other living organisms while competing with each other have evolved to use resources effectively but our ingenuity allowed us to develop
a new evolutionary circumstances-- technology. The combination of evolved behaviors and this new state may destroy us. Over the last 20 years the most successful conservation efforts have been those
that incorporate an individual cost-benefit leverage while the least successful efforts have been those based just on information. Reciprocity is a powerful force that should be considered when
encouraging extension of the meaning of family or shared interest in real ways to benefit conservation programs. A key strategy to solving conservation problems is defining manageable portions of the
problems resulting in a series of small successes creation of a sense of control reduction in frustration and anxiety and promotion of continued enthusiasm. Raising children in a conservation ethic

ratios did not evolve despite extreme conditions of inbreeding. Selection at the colony level is therefore necessary to counteract Fisherian selection within colonies, which here is shown to be acting
regardless of the degree of population subdivision. Smaller size of the founding groups and lower migration rates resulted in more female-biased sex ratios because they reduced the within-group
genetic variance and increased the variance among groups and therefore made selection among groups more effective. The outcome of the selective process, however, depended not only on the degree of
population subdivision (i.e., the ratio of the variances), but also on the relative rate of turnover of the groups and the individuals within them: the lower the rate of colony turnover, the less

Most studies have only analyzed the influence of a single factor, but multifactorial
analyses may be required to understand the biological function of coloration. On procellariiforms (albatrosses and petrels), which comprise 105 seabird species, all with simple coloration (mainly
black and/or white), correspondence analysis was used to find correlations between coloration and species body size, diet, feeding techniques, foraging group sizes, and climate at breeding localities.
Correlations with taxonomic classification were also examined. No single factor played an overwhelming part in determining color patterns, but whereas diet, size, and climate had little effect,
feeding techniques and foraging group sizes had important influences. Classification, at the genus or family level, and color pattern were also correlated. Clusters of species, whether derived from
their color patterns or their feeding ecologies, were similar. Coloration may therefore be related to procellariiform life histories, possibly acting through competition and predation risk. Relative
uniformity of procellariiform coloration, compared with other seabirds, may relate to their peculiar foraging techniques.","Bretagnolle, Vincent"

Over the past three decades, however, a variety of concepts and definitions of dominance
have been introduced, leading to an ongoing debate about the usefulness and meaning of the concept. Criticisms aimed at one definition of dominance do not necessarilly apply to other definitions.
Existing definitions can be structural or functional, refer to roles or to agonistic behaviour, regard dominance as a property of individuals or as an attribute of dyadic encounters, concentrate on
aggression or on the lack of it, and be based either on theoretical constructs or on observable behaviour. Thirteen definitions of dominance are reviewed, and their usefulness assessed with respect to
their descriptive value. The predictive and explanatory values of definitions are specific to the questions asked in each particular study and are not considered as criteria to judge the usefulness of
the dominance concept. By virtue of its high descriptive value, the original definition of dominance by SCHJELDERUPP-EBBE (1922, Z.Psychol. 88: 226-252) emerged as the basis to formulate a structural
definition with wide applicability and which reflects the essence of the concept: Dominance is an attribute of the pattern of repeated, agonistic interactions between two individuals, characterized by
a consistent outcome in favour of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation. The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser
subordinate. Dominance status refers to dyads while dominance rank, high or low, refers to the position in a hierarchy and, thus, depends on group composition. Dominance is a relative measure and not
an absolute property of individuals. The discussion includes reference to the heritability of dominance, application of dominance to groups rather than individuals, and the role of individual
recognition and memory during agonistic encounters.","Drews, Carlos"

Using mainly small groups as models
for the larger flocks normally housed in commercial free-range systems, the role of various social and environmental factors concerning hens' movement and use of space were investigated in this
thesis. Hens displayed a greater readiness to emerge from a familiar covered box into an unfamiliar outdoor area when the outdoor area contained familiar feeders, even though the birds had free access
to food in their home pens. Emergence latencies decreased with repeated testing. Birds also spent more time in the outdoor area when feeders were present, though they tended not to move past the
feeder which was nearest the box. Birds which had been exposed to an enriching stimulus (traffic cones) in their home pens tended to leave the box earlier than those which had not, though this was not
dependent on the actual presence of cones in the outdoor area. This suggests that a more complex home environment can influence birds' responses to novel environments. Furthermore, the order of
emergence into the paddock was not significantly influenced by social rank. Birds which had been regularly exposed to the outside environment during the rearing process displayed little or no fear of
the outdoor area as adults. In contrast, regular handling had little effect on birds' readiness to enter the outdoor area. Regular exposure to the outside environment also reduced birds' underlying
fearfulness (measured by tonic immobility), both in small experimental groups and in a larger free-range flock. Individual birds from small groups or from single cages took longer to move past
unfamiliar birds than they did to move past familiar birds (even those of higher rank), and took longer to move past an increasing number of unfamiliar birds. However, birds in a free-range house
displayed a wide range of movements, and very little aggression, suggesting that any inhibition of movement within the house was not due to ""pecking pressure"" from other birds. Birds displayed greater
readiness to enter into and disperse in the outdoor area when other birds were already present in the area. This was not dependent on the familiarity of birds in the outdoor area. A larger number of
birds in the outdoor area increased the attractiveness of the outdoor area to other birds. The introduction of cover into an outside area had a limited effect on increasing the attractiveness of the
outdoor area to domestic fowl, though this was not reflected in the birds' vigilance behaviour. It was concluded that birds find the outside environment aversive due to its fear-evoking properties
(such as the fear of predation), and to the large discrepancy between the inside and outside environments. Possible implications of the present findings for free-range systems are discussed. CHAPTER
2: General Introduction In this thesis, the effects of various social and environmental factors on the use of space by laying hens are examined, with possible implications for free-range systems. The
following section (1.1.) presents a brief outline of the topic of animal dispersion. This is followed by a review of previous studies which have examined the influence of social and environmental
factors on the use of space by domestic animals, including laying hens (1.2. and 1.3.). The use of space by laying hens in various husbandry systems (including free range) is also discussed (1.4.).
Section 1.5. summarises some of the advantages and disadvantages of various poultry husbandry systems, many of which have implications for the welfare of hens. The free-range system is described in
section 1.6., which is followed by an outline of the thesis (1.7.). 1.1, Animal dispersion The subject of animal dispersion, or the way in which animals distribute themselves in relation to the
available area, has been widely investigated. In his book, Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behaviour, Wynne-Edwards (1962) provided a possible definition of animal dispersion as ""comprising
the placement of individuals and groups of individuals within the habitats they occupy, and the processes by which this is brought about"". Animals may be expected to occupy habitats which provide
resources such as food, nesting sites, mates, shelter, protection from predators, etc. In animal communities, dispersion may serve to control population density, thereby providing a safeguard against
over-population and avoiding over­ exploitation of the food-supply (Wynne-Edwards, 1965). Wynne-Edwards (1962) proposed that dispersion may be brought about by group selection (which is concerned with
the viability and survival of a group of individuals). However, as selection acts primarily at the level of the individual, or, more precisely, at the level of the gene (Davies and Krebs, 1978), it
was later proposed that dispersion is brought about by natural selection, which is concerned with the survival and reproductive success of the individual (Lack, 1966; Pulliam, 1987). Within a habitat,
animals may be more evenly dispersed than they would be at random (""over-dispersed""), or less dispersed than at random (""congregated"") (Crook, 1965). Furthermore, there may be temporal variations in
dispersion, ranging from seasonal variations (such as colonial breeding among some bird species) to diurnal variations (such as birds returning to","Grigor, P. N."

Three levels of evolutionary process are
defined: (1) genetic level-the basic one. Memory of this level is coded, fixed, collected and translated by means of chemical structures (mainly of nucleic acids). The super-organismic system is the
population. Classic natural selection functioned on this level. (2) The epigenetic level had originated with the origin of multicellular organisms and is relatively self-dependent. Regularities of
this level allow the organisms to vary their phenotypes within the limits of reaction norms corresponding to the actual environment. The superorganismic system is the “family group”. Sexual selection
functioned on this level and influenced the genetic one indirectly. (3) The behavioural level had originated on the high stage of evolution with the origin of species that are able to adapt themselves
by behaviour. Their own means of coding, fixation, collection and translation of information have originated from symbolic signals (sounds, smells, postures, gestures, etc.) used for communication
(signal or social heredity). The super-organismic system is society. Group selection functioned on this level. Sociobiology as a science is defined as “the systematic study of the biological basis of
all forms of social behaviour, including sexual and parental behaviour; in all kinds of organisms including man” (Wilson, 1978, p. 10), and has become the necessary tool for the study of human
evolution beginning from its origin.","Leonovicova, V."

theory. We then offer an approach to agency and to power grounded in social rule systems theory. These discussions provide a context to definition of agency as effective, intentional, unconstrained
and reflexive action by individual or collective actors. Using contemporary evolutionary theory, we consider the circumstances under which individual and collective action can meet these requirements
and thus be considered agentic.","Dietz, Thomas and Burns, Tom R."
31,carlson_evolutionary_1992,Evolutionary trends in the articulate brachiopod hinge mechanism,1992-01-01,"Evolutionary patterns in the articulate brachiopod hinge are investigated and this empirical example is used as a model to examine evolutionary trends and evolutionary constraints. Several features of
the hinge-system geometry exhibit persistent directional change from the Cambrian to the Recent and result in increased mechanical advantage in opening the valves. These geometric changes are
reflected also in general features of shell morphology and growth and in patterns of familial diversity through time. Specific, identifiable constraints on brachiopod morphology and function related
to the position of the pedicle and muscles and nature of the hinge line and hinge structures may be said to direct the observed trends. The pattern of evolutionary change among all articulate
brachiopods is most satisfactorily accommodated by a diffusion model of morphological change. Examined independently, the deltidiodonts (with noninterlocking hinge structures) appear to reflect a
process of directional selection through time, whereas change in the cyrtomatodont hinge mechanism (with interlocking teeth and sockets) may reflect the incidental effects of selection for increasing
mantle-cavity volume rather than increasing diductor (opening) muscle moment. The “transition” from deltidiodont to cyrtomatodont hinge structures over the course of brachiopod evolutionary history
may be interpreted from at least two distinctly different perspectives. Paleoecologically, this transition appears to reflect a habitat shift from soft sediment to hard, rocky substrates.
Phylogenetically, the transition reflects the process of evolution: deltidiodonts persist as their modified descendants, the cyrtomatodonts. Investigating the acquisition of evolutionary novelties
over time, or the transition from primitive to derived morphological features, may be the most informative approach to follow in studying evolutionary trends.","Carlson, Sandra J."
50,heinen_human_1992,Human {Behavioural} {Ecology} and {Environmental} {Conservation},1992-01-01,"We contend that humans, as living organisms, evolved to sequester resources to maximize reproductive success, and that many basic aspects of human behaviour reflect this evolutionary history. Much of
the environment with which we currently deal is evolutionarily novel, and much behaviour which is ultimately not in our own interests, persists in this novel environment. Environmentalists frequently
stress the need for ‘sustainable development’, however it is defined ( see Redclift, 1987), and we contend that a knowledge of how humans are likely to behave with regard to resource use, and
therefore a knowledge of what kinds of programmes are likely to work in any particular situation, is necessary to achieve sustainability. Specifically, we predict that issues which are short-term,
local, and/or acute, such as an immediate health-risk, will be much easier to solve than issues which are broad, and which affect individuals other than ourselves, our relatives, and our friends. The
bigger the issue is, the less effective is likely to be the response. Hence, the biggest and most troublesome ecological issues will be the most difficult to solve — inter alia because of our
evolutionary history as outlined above.   This may not appear to bode well for the future of the world; for example, Molte (1988) contends that there are several hundred international environmental
agreements in place, but Carroll (1988) contends that, in general, none of them is particularly effective if the criterion for effectiveness is a real solution to the problem. There are countless
examples of ‘aggressors’ (those nations causing the problem) not complying with an agreement, slowing its ratification, or reducing its effectiveness ( e.g. the US versus Canada, or Great Britain
versus Sweden, with regard to acid rain legislation: Fig. 1, cf. Bjorkbom, 1988). The main problem in these cases is that the costs are externalized and hence discounted by those receiving the
benefits of being able to pollute. Any proposed change is bound to conflict with existing social structures, and negotiations necessarily involve compromise in a quid pro quo fashion (Brewer, 1980).
We contend, along with Caldwell (1988) and Putnam (1988), that nations are much too large to think of as individual actors in these spheres. Interest groups within nations can affect ratification of
international environmental treaties; for example, automobile industry interests versus those of environmental NGOs in the USA on the acid rain issue. It may even be that our evolutionary history is
inimical to the entire concept of the modern nation state.  Barring major, global, socio-political upheaval, we suggest that a knowledge of the evolution of resource use by humans can be used to solve
at least some resource-related problems in modern industrial societies. In some cases, these can probably be solved with information alone, and in other cases, the problems can probably be solved by
playing on our evolutionary history as social reciprocators; environmental problems which tend to be relatively local and short-term may be solvable in these ways. Economic incentives can provide
solutions to many other types of problems by manipulating the cost and benefits to individuals. We suggest that broader, large-scale environmental problems are much more difficult to solve than
narrower, small-scale ones, precisely because humans have evolved to discount such themes; stringent regulations and the formation of coalitions, combined with economic incentives to use alternatives
and economic disincentives (fines) not to do so, may be the only potential solutions to some major, transboundary environmental issues.  In preparing this argument, we have reviewed literature from
many scholarly fields well outside the narrow scope of our expertise in behavioural ecology and wildlife conservation. Our reading of many works from anthropology, economics, political science, public
policy, and international development, will doubtless seem naïve and simplistic to practitioners of those fields, and solving all environmental problems will ultimately take expertise from all of
these fields and more. In general, however, we have found agreement for many of our ideas from these disparate disciplines, but much of their literature does not allow for a rigorous, quantitative
hypothesis-testing approach to analysing the main thesis presented here — an approach that we, as scientists, would encourage. We hope to challenge people interested in environmental issues from many
perspectives, to consider our arguments and find evidence, pro or con , so that we (collectively) may come closer to a better analysis of, and ultimately to solutions for, our most pressing
environmental problems.","Heinen, Joel T. and Low, Roberta (‘Bobbi’) S."

of producing offspring, inevitably reproduce below the physiological maximum. But it seems difficult to argue that, for example, human couples in developed societies, which barely reproduce on the
replacement level, are reproducing at the maximums which the circumstances in the risky and unpredictable environment of modern times allowed. In industrialized societies a woman can easily have 8–10
children without any negative effect on her remaining age specific fecundity or her longevity (Voland and Engel 1989, with further references). But not only in modern, also in very primitive societies

62,stenseth_social_1992,Social factors in immigration and emigration,1992-01-01,"Social behaviour comprises behaviour directed at other individuals often for the purpose of affecting their actions, such as altering spacing, enhancing cohesiveness of group members, and establishing
the order of access to resources. Because dispersal (emigration and immigration) of small mammals occurs in a social milieu, social behaviour has often been proposed as a cause of emigration or a
limit to immigration. Likewise, social behaviour may in turn be affected by dispersal regimes; for example, emigration may decrease the incidence of aggressive behaviour as individuals become
relatively more scarce. Social behaviour could also serve as an intervening variable correlated with but not directly a cause of particular dispersal patterns. Furthermore, social behaviour and
dispersal may be connected by feedback loops such that a particular dispersal pattern may cause changes in social behaviour, which in turn may modify dispersal patterns. Types of social behaviour
likely to be relevant to dispersal include aggressive behaviour (e.g. fighting, chasing, threatening postures), affiliative behaviour (e.g. naso-nasal contact, grooming), mating behaviour, and so-
called altruistic behaviours (e.g. alarm calling, predator attraction through feigning injury, aiding in territory defence).","Brandt, C. A."

estimate the world population of an avian species, because seabirds are often large and conspicuous and breed in imposing colonies that invite census. The colonial habit of seabirds also encourages
studies of breeding and demography, as large amounts of data can be gathered without need to search for widely dispersed nests. David Lack, doubtlessly inspired by early seabird exposure in Iceland
and Bear Island, used marine birds prominently in developing the hypothesis that breeding systems evolve to maximize reproductive output (Lack, 1954, 1966, 1967). Seabirds were also presented as
champions of the opposing view, now in disfavor, that animals may limit reproduction for the benefit of the species (Wynne-Edwards, 1962).","Cairns, David K."

coordinated physiological response (similar to the inflammatory response). ‘Cancer initiating genes’ are presumed neoplastic DNA sequences involved in sensing genome deterioration, consequently
enhancing preservation. This genetic trait, different from the concept of oncogenes, actively triggers the neoplastic transformation once genome deterioration is sensed. This self destructive,
altruistic phenomenon, obviously devastating to the organism, is nevertheless shown to be a possible mechanism of natural selection. The survival advantage of cancer initiation is discussed using both
the concepts of group selection and gene selection. Natural selection, the driving force of evolution, is believed to operate solely on the basis of phenotype differences among individuals. In this
paper cancer is hypothesized to be a mechanism that directly scrutinizes the gene contents of the individual, therefore representing natural selection based on genotype differences.","Blumenthal, E."

characteristics that tend to make them vulnerable to human activity. They are long-lived and reproduce slowly; they tend to breed in large numbers on predator-free islands; and they feed in relatively
small areas of high biological productivity. Universal management problems include egging, hunting, oiling, contamination with persistent pollutants, and competition with commercial fisheries. Future
problems are likely to include range shifts because of global warming, loss of nesting sites because of sea level rise, increased human disturbance, and competition with humans for marine resources.
Rapid advances in technology, such as doubly-labelled water, instrumentation for measurement of foraging and growth, satellite tracking, and non-lethal sampling for diet allow increasingly detailed
basic information on the biology of seabirds. At sea, while methods of counting birds have improved to allow estimates of density, the greatest advances have been made in linking bird distribution to
oceanographie features such as primary productivity, fronts, and distribution of prey. In contrast to the advances in research, relatively few management techniques have been developed primarily for
seabirds; most focus on maintaining or restoring island or marine ecosystems used by seabirds, by removing introduced predators or regulating fisheries. The two most promising advances in seabird
management and research in the next decade or so are likely to involve large-scale cooperative projects to identify and protect critical breeding islands and foraging sites at sea, and the use of
scientifically-sound models designed for management of populations of seabirds.","Duffy, David C. and Nettleship, David N."

33,stenseth_animal_1992,Animal {Dispersal}: {Small} mammals as a model,1992-01-01,"concepts which are hard to measure and may not have been demonstrated (such as saturation and carrying capacity). Gaines and McClenaghan (1980) wrote that there is no operational way of distinguishing
the two types, because there is no way of defining, let alone measuring, carrying capacity (but see Chapters 7 and 9). This is controversial, and many workers find 'carrying capacity' a useful term,
but others think it suffers from drawbacks and so is better avoided. One reason for the difficulty of defining and measuring carrying capacity in animal studies in general is that the limiting
resource (assuming that there is one) is so seldom identified. If it is identified, as in some insect studies, it can usually be measured. Or, an area's carrying capacity can be defined differently as
the density above which the population growth rate becomes negative, but this would be a circular definition. Nevertheless, it is worth discussing different types of emigration behaviour. One can
think broadly of two types of behaviour. Type A involves a subordinate individual, which is unlikely to breed unless it finds a vacancy due to a more dominant individual dying, and which otherwise is
likely to die itself. Type B involves an individual, not necessarily subordinate, which moves to places where density is lower, or perhaps more importantly where the increase phase of the population
fluctuation is about to begin, and which may thereby be more likely to produce recruits. [Types A and B may be the same as, but are not necessarily the same as, Lidicker's (1975) suggestion that
saturation dispersers in small mammals would be social outcasts in poor condition, whereas presaturation dispersers would survive well in newly colonized habitats (see also Chapters 2 and 10).] We
have found examples of A and B in red grouse. With A, aggressiveness and breakup of families in autumn were followed by the formation of 266 A red grouse perspective on dispersal a non-territorial
social class. Most of its members died of socially induced mortality and emigration over winter, though a few replaced the relatively few territorial birds that died (Watson, 1985; Watson and Moss,
1990). Red grouse with type B behaviour showed emigration of two kinds during years of high and declining density, and a third kind at the end of population troughs (Watson et al., 1984). In the first
kind, the proportion of adult pairs emigrating shortly before egg-laying was zero at low density and high at high density. In the second kind, the proportion that stayed in the area until their chicks
hatched, but then emigrated with their chicks and returned in autumn without them, was highest in years of declining densities. In such years, very few of the young reared in the area were successful
in obtaining territories and thus being recruited into the breeding population. The third kind of type B behaviour involved birds immigrating to areas at the end of population troughs in these areas,
when the increase phase was about to begin there. Moss and Watson (1985, 1990) suggested in evolutionary terms why such emigrant red grouse should leave. It is important to realize that animals
showing behaviour of type A might show type B in a different social setting or in a different phase of the population fluctuation. Lidicker's (1975) comparisons of numbers with density of small
mammals did not involve the percentage emigrating, but he came near it by writing that if emigration were to stop population growth at carrying capacity, it necessarily 'makes up a very large fraction
of the losses.' Unfortunately, many workers on small mammals ignored this lead until recently, by paying no attention to the proportion emigrating. Lidicker (1975) also wrote that if losses from
presaturation emigration occur during periods of population growth, the resulting growth rate will be 'correspondingly less', and 'if a population accepts immigrants they add directly to the growth
rate by increasing the additions per unit of time' (p. 114). The assumption here, which has often been made with birds as well as small mammals, is that losses (or gains) are additive and that none
shows complete compensation. It is an assumption that needs testing. Krebs (1986) wrote, 'Whether mortality factors are additive or compensatory is one of the most pressing and most difficult
questions in mammalian ecology' . Yes, and add 'bird ecology' to this for good measure. Krebs et al. (1973) found that the dispersal 'rate' of small mammals, which in this case was the number
dispersing per two-week trapping period, was inversely correlated with the rate of change in numbers. The use of 'rate' instead of number in that paper and in other papers on small mammals has led
other workers to publish misleading accounts, including myself in Moss et al. (1982, Figure 4.7), and also Morris (1984, summary and Figure 1). Although Dekker (1975) wrote (p. 65) of 'the
proportionality between dispersal and the rate of change of the total population', what Different types of emigration 267 he actually meant was that the number of dispersers per acre per week was
correlated with the rate of population change. In their review of the literature on 'dispersal' in small mammals, Gaines and McClenaghan (1980) mentioned (p. 169) a positive correlation between
'dispersal rate' and density, but their Table 2 reveals that for nine species with adequate data, only four showed a statistically significant positive correlation. Gaines and McClenaghan pointed to
studies where percentage losses due to dispersal were correlated with the population's rate of increase. But does this mean that dispersal is one limiting factor preventing continued population
increase though not causing declines, or is it simply a compensatory form of loss? They also found evidence in the literature that percentage losses from dispersal during the increase phase exceeded
those during declines. Krebs et al. (1973) had already reached this conclusion from their observation that the number dispersing per two weeks was highest during the increase phase rather than during
the peak or the decline. They were probably right, though their observation on its own is not sufficient to be sure about this conclusion. If one takes it at face value, the direction of the trend is
the opposite of that needed if emigration is to be a direct, important demographic cause of population declines [see Warkowska-Dratnal and Stenseth (1985) and Stenseth and Lomnicki (1990) for further
discussion and references]. Gaines and McClenaghan concluded (p. 189) that considering all the evidence 'the lack of density-dependence suggests that dispersal may not operate as a mechanism of
population regulation', and that dispersal is clearly density-independent. Rates of loss that are not positively densitydependent obviously cannot 'regulate' numbers, if one uses 'regulate' in the
sense of density-dependent returns of numbers to a supposed 'equilibrium density' after departures from it (Varley et aI., 1973). Such losses that are not positively density-dependent will, however,
tend to lengthen the time taken for peak density to be reached, or will reduce the peak density, provided that there is not complete compensation for these losses. A different, related point is that
it might be useful with small mammals and birds to consider models other than the equilibrium one, for example the ceiling model as used by some entomologists (Milne, 1957; Dempster, 1983). Krebs
(Chapter 7) has made a useful advance and cleared up some confusion by doing statistical analysis on whether dispersal 'rate' (this time an index of per capita dispersal rate, and so equivalent to a
percentage) was correlated with breeding density in a non-cyclic population of Microtus townsendii. The two were correlated. However, what about cyclic populations of small mammals? Before we accept
the statement that dispersal rate is not correlated with density in such cyclic populations, the lack of this correlation requires equally rigorous statistical analysis. And, 268 A red grouse
perspective on dispersal although 'dispersal' rate may seem unlikely to be a strong, delayed densitydependent factor in small mammals, this question too does not appear to have been answered clearly
by statistical analysis. 12.7 EMIGRATION, IMMIGRATION, CYCLES, AND IRREGULAR FLUCTUATIONS There is interesting anecdotal evidence that ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbelIus) in small isolated fragments of
forest remaining after clearance for agriculture do not show cycles and are fairly stable in numbers, unlike those in large tracts of boreal forest (Leopold, 1931; Graham and Hunt, 1958; Ammann,
1972). Watson and Moss (1979) suggested that populations need not show cycles when 'dispersal' is continuously high, as strong competition for space or other resources at home may thereby be avoided.
They gave as a possible example the blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus), where new habitat continually becomes available due to forest succession after fire (Zwickel and Bendell, 1972). Red grouse in
marginal habitat in Mayo, western Ireland (Watson and O'Hare, 1979; Watson and Moss, 1979) and on Mull in western Scotland (Watson et al., 1987) is another example. Shooting bags from former decades
fluctuated greatly, as in east Scotland today. Declines, and increases, often lasted several years each. Densities now are lower, and on unmanipulated moorland on Mull they fluctuated little during a
recent study. Habitat in Mayo and Mull has deteriorated, due to careless burning of vegetation and overgrazing by sheep. Areas of favourable habitat now adjoin large areas of poorer habitat, and
temporarily vacant ground is common. Emigration to poorer areas may be preventing longer population increases and higher peaks on the better habitat. Large-amplitude fluctuations of red grouse may be
associated with large areas of good habitat from which it is possible to emigrate to poorer areas (Moss and Watson, 1990), but per",

service paid to the interaction. In North America the comparative study of animal behavior was overshadowed by the growth of an experimental psychology that produced the general-process view of
learning, holding that the mechanisms underlying learning are much the same in all species. That made evolution irrelevant. During the same period ethology emerged in Europe as the study of naturally
occurring behavior in an evolutionary context. Because evolution is fundamental to ethology, the genetic basis of behavior was a central precept. Ethology and psychology collided after World War II.
After a vigorous exchange on the issues, a synthesis by Robert Hinde materialized, one that advanced the study of behavior and produced a sophisticated understanding of nature and nurture. A few
decades later sociobiology appeared and was immediately assailed for making what were seen as unwarranted extensions from animal to human behavior, and for emphasizing genetic control of behavior.
Much of the debate that ensued was distractingly political and threw little light on the scientific merits of the issues although it moderated the stance of sociobiologists; on the other hand, the
politically inspired debates may have harmed the field of animal behavior.","Barlow, George W."

circumstances, resource management could be selectively advantageous. Much of the recent literature on plant-herbivore interactions suggest that herbivory can result in changes in the resource base
which are assumed to increase the intake and fitness of the herbivore. As a result, a number of authors suggest that herbivores manage their resource utilisation to maximise the flow of nutrients from
these resources. Long term territoriality or the exclusive use of a home range are the social systems most likely to favour selection for prudent resource exploitation. This review argues that, in
many habitats, resource management strategies are not feasible, as individuals have little control over the way resources are depleted and renewed. Thus far, very little evidence is available showing

of variation, selection, and transmission potentially have powerful applications in sociology. In such uses, a crucial distinction must be made between developmental processes and evolutionary
processes. Two main approaches characterize current evolutionary thinking in sociology: sociobiological explanations, and coevolutionary accounts of the interaction of genes and culture. Evolution
through natural selection can occur with genes, cultural elements, and any other self-replicating codes. Although social learning is the cultural analogue of genetic transmission, cultural evolution
does not necessarily maximize genetic fitness. Newly emerging sociological theories of evolution hold promise of integrating micro- and macroprocesses, providing explanations of complexity and

themselves. There are many sources of empirical and theoretical support for this view, including (1) the inclusive fitness theory of altruism, (2) kin recognition studies of animals raised apart, (3)
assortative mating studies, (4) favoritism in families, (5) selective similarity among friends, and (6) ethnocentrism. Specific tests of the theory show that (1) sexually interacting couples who
produce a child are genetically more similar to each other in blood antigens than they are either to sexually interacting couples who fail to produce a child or to randomly paired couples from the
same sample; (2) similarity between marriage partners is most marked in the more genetically influenced of sets of anthropometric, cognitive, and personality characteristics; (3) after the death of a
child, parental grief intensity is correlated with the child's similarity to the parent; (4) long-term male friendship pairs are more similar to each other in blood antigens than they are to random
dyads from the same sample; and (5) similarity among best friends is most marked in the more genetically influenced of sets of attitudinal, personality, and anthropometric characteristics. The

Ian G. Henderson From December 1985 to
December 1988, an study was made of the functional significance of rook and jackdaw flocks with a view to identifying reasons for intra and interspecific flock cohesiveness. Flocks of rooks were
investigated by way of behavioural observation for competitive heterogeneity and the impact of such on the dispersion of individual members. Thus, immature and adult birds were compared for their
respective abilities to compete within foraging flocks. Evidence for kin selection in foraging flocks was investigated in jackdaws by way of behavioural observation of individually marked (wing
tagged) birds and using DNA fingerprinting to ascertain the degree of relatedness between associating individuals. Interspecific associations were studied a) to identify the similarities and
differences between foraging rooks and jackdaws and b) to provide hypotheses for functional flocking without cause for genetically related explanations. Immature rooks did not forage as efficiently as
adults in larger flocks, and thus selected smaller flocks, with higher immature : adult ratios. Adult interference was a possible cause of immature dispersion. Kin selection was not found to be a
significant component of co-foraging groups, though female jackdaws had higher than average levels of relatedness, possibly due to lower female than male dispersal. The daily behaviour of rooks and
jackdaws was remarkably similar and 80\% of foraging flocks contained both species. Commonly co-occuring food resources, low direct resource competition and subsequent low levels of interspecific
aggression were thought responsible for this association. In conclusion, competitive heterogeneity was found in rooks that effected individual dispersion, discouraging young birds rather than
encouraging them, to remain within the colony. Likewise little evidence of kin selection was found in foraging jackdaws. Rooks and jackdaws associated together frequently, on the basis, it was
suggested, of where one species was feeding, the other was also likely to forage successfully.","Henderson, I."

share the point of view that the principles of natural selection apply at levels of biological organization above the level of the individual organism. This leads them both to considermultilevel
selection situations, where selection is occurring simultaneously at more than one level. Impeding unification of the theoretical approaches of the multilevel selection traditions are the different
goals of investigators in the different subdisciplines and the different types of data potentially available for analysis. We identify two alternative approaches to multilevel situations, which we
termmultilevel selection [1] andmultilevel selection [2]. Of interest in the former case are the effects of group membership onindividual fitnesses, and in the latter the tendencies for the groups
themselves to go extinct or to found new groups (i.e., group fitnesses). We argue that: neither represents the entire multilevel selection process; both are aspects of any multilevel selection
situation; and both are legitimate approaches, suitable for answering different questions. Using this formalism, we show that: multilevel selection [2] does not require “emergent” group properties in
order to provide an explanatory mechanism of evolutionary change; multilevel selection [1] is usually more appropriate for neontological group selection studies; and species selection is most
fruitfully considered from the point of view of multilevel selection [2]. Finally we argue that the “effect hypothesis” of macroevolution, requiring, in selection among species, both the absence of
group effects on organismic fitness (multilevel selection [1]), and the direct determination of species fitnesses by those of organisms, is untestable with paleontological data. Furthermore, the
conditions for the effect hypothesis to hold are extremely restrictive and unlikely to apply to the vast majority of situations encountered in nature.","Damuth, John and Heisler, I. Lorraine"

the largest and the nesting density was medium and on Yururi, where the nesting density was the highest and the population size was medium. Therefore, intraspecific predation was not a density
dependent mortality factor of chicks, hence, could not regulate population dynamics. The regional difference in the occurrence of intraspecific predation did not always relate to breeding synchrony or
to chick guarding by parents. Twenty percent of individual male gulls probably were responsible for most of the intraspecific predation. Reproductive success of pairs including these cannibal males
was not significantly different from that of non cannibal pairs including males that fed their offspring with seabird chicks but did not prey upon conspecific chicks. Therefore, pairs including

sensory basis of trail following in caterpillars. By selective ablations of chemosensory organs we show that, in Malacosoma, the trail chemical is perceived by the maxillary palpi. In another
lepidopteran species, Yponomeuta cagnagellus, the palpi are needed to discriminate their own trails from a trail of Malacosoma. Malacosoma larvae also lose their specificity for conspecific trails
when their palpi are ablated. Volatile cues evidently do not play a role in trail‐following behaviour, since neither Malacosoma nor Yponomeuta can orient on a trail covered with fine nylon mesh. These
data indicate that for Malacosoma, and probably also for Yponomeuta, contact chemoreception mediated by the maxillary palpi is the primary mode of pheromone perception. The evolution of receptor

termites that do produce either neotenic or adultoid reproductives. The rate of supplementary and replacement reproduction, however, varies greatly between different taxa. Prediction 2 is not upheld
for the majority of termites because primary reproductives tend to be long lived and primary-headed colonies do generate alates. It may be upheld for Mastotermes, many of the Rhinotermitidae, and some
Termitidae. Prediction 3 appears to be true for most termines, although support for it is inferential only. The breeding pedigrees of termites vary greatly with their ecological specializations and it
is unlikely that Bartz's model can be reconciled to such variation. Bart's hypothesis also makes certain assumptions about the nature of caste differentiation and the nature of the behavior underlying
the sociality of termites. These assumptions are discussed and some criticisms are made. We conclude that inbreeding according to Bartz's model may be a contributing factor in the social evolution of

group selection. We discuss the differing roles of mathematical and laboratory models in constructing selective explanations at the group level and apply our discussion to the units of selection

requirement, increasing by small increments from 1 (i = 6, n = 6) to 2 (i = 2, n = 1), between ages 10 and 50 days. Food delivered each night (SUM) was estimated by 24-h increments in chick mass. In
nonexperimental nests SUM varied significantly among pairs, and chick mass varied in direct relation to SUM. Adults tending experimental nests did not respond to increased food demand, and chick mass
decreased with increasing chick-equivalent per nest. After rotations were terminated, the mass of most chicks increased quickly to normal levels. These results suggest that the average amount of food
delivered daily by each parent is determined independently of food demand and that chicks attain a mass that balances a fixed food intake against food requirement, which varies in direct relation to
mass.","Ricklefs, Robert E."

By characterizing the process as consisting of two essential steps—interaction and transmission—a singular answer to the unit question becomes ambiguous. With such an account on hand, two recent
defenses of competing units of selection are considered. Richard Dawkins maintains that the gene is the appropriate unit of selection and Robert Brandon, in response, argues that the individual
organism is better suited to the role. This paper argues that by making explicit the underlying questions that each of these views addresses, the apparent conflict can be resolved. Furthermore, such a
resolution allows for a more complete and realistic understanding of the process of evolution by natural selection.","Mitchell, Sandra D."

the effects of microscopic diversity have been largely neglected. We show that evolution will select for populations which retain “variability,” even though this is, at any given time, loss-making,
predicting that we shall not observe populations with “optimal behavior,” but populations which can “learn.” This lesser short-term efficiency may be why natural diversity is so great. Evolution is

At
the evolutionarily stable strategy, the proportional gain in the success of an offspring from an increment in the investment in the offspring equals the proportional loss in offspring numbers. A
parallel marginal-value theorem applies to discontinuous variation in the amount of care. When selection acts directly on offspring size rather than on number, the evolutionarily stable level of care
depends only on the fitness curve relating the fitness of single offspring to the amount of resources received. General conditions for brood reduction are described. A more-specific rapid-gain version
of the continuous model suggests that the amount of parental care is influenced primarily by the level of care at which offspring success increases rapidly. The model can explain various observed
differences in amounts of parental care, such as those of r-selected versus K-selected species. The work of an unrecognized predecessor of r- and K-selection theory, E. J. Salisbury, is acknowledged.
There are many other size-number compromises, including those for repeated plant structures and for the number of broods per year and other ""packaging"" strategies, to which models paralleling those

quantitative anthropological and ecological studies in Highlands New Guinea has not shown clearly which of these three models best describes reality. Simulation of shifting agriculture in New Guinea
shows that the Highlands systems are equilibrium-seeking, but have such limited recovery rates from disturbance that even small perturbations are sufficient to keep them from reaching equilibrium.

Perhaps the advances made in this
field are best measured by the degree to which its ideas have impinged upon the think­ ing of evolutionists as a whole. Not since Simpson singlehandedly injected paleontology into the evolutionary
mainstream (1944) has our science been so highly regarded in evolutionary circles. Patterns and Processes in the History of Life, the record of a Dahlem Workshop held in June 1985, clearly reflects
the current importance of analyt­ ical paleobiology. Its contents chronicle an ear­ nest, and largely successful, effort to bring biology and paleontology closer to new understanding. Dahlem
Konferenzen follow a special format, the Dahlem Workshop Model. Under this model, four independent groups are established, each of which has a certain focus, in this case: ' 'directions in the history
of life,"" ""microand macroevolutionary processes in organismic evolution,"" ""causes and consequences of extinction,"" and ""ecological patterns and processes."" The partic­ ipants, each of whom is assigned
to a particular group, submit ""background papers"" prior to the conference. These are distributed in advance and provide the basis for group discussions that are the primary focus. No lectures are
given, unlike typical symposia. Based upon the discussions, each group prepares a group report specifying areas of agreement or disagreement and outlining directions for further inquiry. The published
rec­ ord of the workshop, the Dahlem Workshop Re­ port, includes the four group reports, the back­ ground papers (15 of them), and three other papers of an introductory nature. A Dahlem Workshop
Report is by its very nature not a synthetic work; the views and styles of its contributors are far too diverse. Neverthe­ less, a group of theoretical and empirical con­ cerns, shared by both
biologists and paleontologists, is expressed both explicitly and implicitly in Dahlem Workshop Report No. 36 and can be abstracted into a set of coherent emerging themes that need to be incorporated
into an ex­ panded theory of evolution. Constraint.—Constraint is one of those emerg­ ing themes. The conference participants agreed that constraints exist and that they are in some way important. But
there was little agreement regarding what a constraint is in theory, or how to recognize one in practice. A major difficulty, as Stearns points out, is the fact that"" 'constraint' is a covering term
hiding a diversity of meanings . . ."" (p. 33) . Those who hold to a classical mor­ phological tradition, for example, may assert that it is ""constraints of Bauplan""—deeply ingrained and interactive
patterns of embryonic develop­ ment guided by highly integrated genetic pro­ grams—that render specifiable ends highly im­ probable even if they may be advantageous. Wagner, who writes that
constraints are implicit in the fact of homology (and thus in the very fact that we can tell that evolution has occurred), emphasizes constraints of this sort. Under this classical view, constraint is
taxon specific, a func­ tion of what Stearns calls ""intermediate struc­ ture,"" the set of processes interposed between the genotypic program of a particular taxon and its phenotypic pattern. Other
concepts, such as con­ straint ""by physical laws"" (Stearns, p. 34) , which subsumes various biomechanical principles in­ cluding the relation between body mass and limb cross-section, are taxon non-
specific. Though LaBarbera, in his essay, justly questions our knowledge of such biomechanical laws, it does seem that such rules, when more completely understood, may play a role in establishing rig­
orous concepts of constraint. Maynard Smith et al. (1985) identify two general classes of constraint, universal and local, corresponding closely to Stearns's ""constraint by physical laws"" and
constraints of ""intermediate structure,"" respectively. It may eventually be pos­ sible to specify universal constraints a priori from known physical principles. But it seems to me that purported local
constraints can only be re­ jected, never verified. Stearns alludes to this log-","Gilinsky, Norman L."

concepts of life history analysis with those of population regulation, both in an evolutionary context (for example, Boyce, 1984). Much of the literature dealing with population regulation covers
research on fishes and insects, with some work devoted to the study of birds (Nikolskii, 1969; Lack, 1966; Clark et al., 1967; Weatherly, 1972; Varley et al., 1973; Hassel, 1975; Gulland, 1977).

conditions: unlimited good quality food, and limited good quality food plus unlimited low quality food. Weight changes, as an index of condition, were monitored for 7-15 d. Then treatments were
reversed. The resource-behaviour hypothesis predicts that social behaviour causes differential survival through weight loss, only when food is limited. The results corroborate this multi-factor
hypothesis, and were contrary to the predictions of the others. The resource hypothesis predicts that with limited good food, all animals should lose weight. However, dominant animals were unaffected
by limited food. The self-regulation hypothesis predicts that social behaviour results in weight loss and hence poor survival for some individuals with excess food. Results showed residents and
immigrants did not differ in weight change.","Sinclair, A. R. E."

Harvey and Greenwood 1978; Weldon 1983). What benefits might the sender derive in return for the energy expended, and perhaps the risk incurred, by sending an alarm signal? Postulated benefits are
conferred at three levels of relationship: group, kin, and individual. If group selection were acting, the group as a whole rather than the individual sender might benefit (Wynne-Edwards 1962). Kin-
selection benefits (Hamilton 1963, 1964; Maynard Smith 1965; Sherman 1977) would operate if the alarm signal protects individuals sharing genes with the sender. Selection at the individual level might
act if sending alarm signals increases the sender's fitness. Several individual benefits of alarm signaling have been postulated. Trivers (1971) suggested that warning conspecifics would decrease the
hunting success of predators and make it less likely that the predators would be sustained by the meal, form a specific search image for the sender's type of prey, learn to hunt the prey species
effectively, hunt in the sender's area, and learn the area in which the sender lives. These effects should reduce predation on the sender and thus repay it for sending the signal in low-risk
situations. Trivers (1971) also proposed that senders might benefit if the warned receivers were likely to reciprocate in the future. Trivers emphasized the importance of restricting benefits to
receivers that would reciprocate rather than cheat. Charnov and Krebs (1975) suggested that senders might benefit if the movement of the alarmed receivers distracted the predator from the sender. The
receivers might then be more likely to be caught. Others have suggested that alarm signals might draw a group closer together, thus reducing predator success (McCullough 1969; Hamilton 1971; Owens and
Goss-Custard 1976; Hirth and McCullough 1977), or warn group members to act cryptically, thereby avoiding detection of the group by a predator (Dawkins 1976). Some have argued that so-called alarm
signals may in fact signal to a predator that it has been discovered. Predators receptive to such signals might terminate hunting episodes rather than expend time and energy in pursuit of alerted
prey. This would spare the prey unnecessary chases (Smythe 1970, 1977; Tilson and Norton 1981). Curio (1978) discussed","Smith, R. J. F."

Individual differences should be expressed in reproductive output, dispersal,
social behavior, and recruitment. Mirror-image stimulation (MIS; i.e., exposure ofthe animal to a large mirror) was used as an independent measure of individuality, which could be distributed
continuously or which could be grouped into two or more types. Three axes derived from a factor analysis of behavioral data obtained during MIS accounted for 85\% ofthe variance among individual
marmots. The rank order of 19 adult females on each of the three MIS axes was not correlated with the rank order of lifetime reproductive success measured as number of young weaned, number of
yearlings produced, or number of young or yearlings produced per year of residency. This result suggests that individual differences are not continuous. Each female was assigned to one of three groups
according to the MIS axis on which she had her highest factor score. Rankings for the number of female yearlings, number of recruits, and number of 2-yr-old resident daughters varied significantly
among the MIS groups. Mean values of these measures were highest for females in the ""sociability"" group. Although none of eight measures of lifetime social behavior for 18 females was significantly
related to the three MIS groups, several measures of lifetime amicable behavior were correlated with the production and recruitment of female yearlings. Behavior in the field is affected not only by
individual behavioral phenotypes, but also by kinship and patterns of space use. Marmots may have a strategy of phenotypic plasticity. By producing young of varied phenotypes, a female increases the
probability that over the long term some of her descendants will survive in varied and unpredictable social and ecological environments.","Armitage, Kenneth B."

central Alberta. The goal was to determine whether an effect of cold on daily roosting time could be observed and distinguished from that of other environmental factors. Multiple linear regression
analysis on the data revealed that, all other things being equal, magpies left the roost later relative to sunrise, and returned to it earlier relative to sunset on colder days, and also (i) on longer
days, (ii) on darker, cloudier days, (iii) in the second half of winter, when compared with the first half, and (iv) when fewer birds were using the roost. These results held true only before the
occurrence of overt territorial behaviour in March, which coincided with a notable shift towards earlier departures and later arrivals. The larger amount of time spent in the roost by magpies when it
was cold may be related to an increased predisposition to inactivity induced by cold temperatures, or to possible microclimatological advantages offered by the roost. The amplitude of this temperature
effect may, however, be dependent on the birds' level of hunger. Indeed, the effect of temperature on roosting times was much weaker in the case of departure, i.e., after a long night of food
deprivation, than it was in the case of arrival.","Reebs, S. G."

Darwin's reading of Malthus led him to appreciate the importance of population
pressures, and subsequently of natural selection, with the help of the “wedge” metaphor. But, in itself, natural selection did not furnish an adequate account of the origin of species, for which a
principle of divergence was needed. Initially, Darwin attributed this to geographical isolation, but later, following his work on barnacles which underscored the significance of variation, and arising
from his work on “botanical arithmetic,” he supposed that diversity allowed more “places” to be occupied in a given region. So isolation was not regarded as essential. Large regions with intense
competition, and with ample variation spread by blending, would facilitate speciation. The notion of “place” was different from “niche,” and it is questioned whether Darwin's views on ecology were as
modern as is commonly supposed. Two notions of “struggle” are found in Darwin's theory; and three notions of “variation.” Criticisms of his theory led him to emphasize the importance of “variation”
over a range of forms. Hence the theory was “populational” rather than “typological.” The theory required a “Lamarckian” notion of inheritable changes initiated by the environment as a source of
variation. Also, Darwin deployed a “use/habit” theory; and the notion of sexual selection. Selection normally acted at the level of the individual, though “kin selection” was possible. “Group
selection” was hinted at for man. Darwin's thinking (and also the exposition of his theory) was generally guided by the domestic-organism analogy, which satisfied his methodological requirement of a
vera causa principle.","Oldroyd, David R."

The data on fertility
differentials among contemporary humans are not cotvietent with this postulate. Given the importance of Homo sapiens as an animal species in the natural world today, these data constitute particularly
challenging and interesting problem for both human sociobiology and sociobiology as a whole.  The first part of this paper reviews the evidence showing an inverse relationship between reproductive
fitness and “endowment” (i.e. wealth, success, and measured aptitudes) in contemporary, urbanized societies. It is shown that a positive relationship is observed only for those cohorts who bore their
children during a unique period of rising fertility, 1935–1960, and that these cohorts are most often cited by sociobiologists as supporting the central postulate of sociobiology. Cohorts preceding
and following these show the characteristic inverse relationship between endowment and fertility. The second section reviews the existing so-ciobiological models of this inverse relationship, namely,
those of Barkow, Burley, and Irons, as well as more informal responses among sociobiologists to the persistent violation of sociobiology's central postulate, such as those of Alexander and Dawkins.
The third section asks whether the goals of sociobiology, given the violation of its fundamental postulate by contemporary human societies, might not be better thought of as applied rather than
descriptive, with respect to these societies. A proper answer to this question begins with the measurement of the pace and direction of natural selection within modern human populations, as compared
to other sources of change. The vast preponderance of the shifts in human trait distributions, including the IQ distribution, appears to be due to environmental rather than genetic change. However,
there remains the question of just how elastic these distributions are in the absence of reinforcing genetic change.","Vining, Daniel R."

associated implications for the evolution of altruism, and (b) the use of mathematical models, notably optimality and games theory models. Third, it is suggested that the evolutionary functional
approach can enrich the study of comparative psychology in the following ways: (a) by providing a broad framework for interspecific comparisons based on the principle of natural selection, and (b) by
aiding the study of motivation and learning mechanisms through focusing attention on the function of such mechanisms.","Archer, John"

develop in patterned yet flexible and individually variable ways as a result of the interaction of biological and environmental variables including, among the latter, those elements of the social

acts to protect this positive association against cheats. This definition, unlike those in current use, incorporates the essential features of the traditional verbal arguments by excluding the effects
of individual selection and incorporating the problem of cheating. Kin selection is considered an example of group selection in which the ""groups"" are associations of relatives and in which special
mechanisms, such as individual recognition, maintain the integrity of the associations. The ""groups"" of group selection are quite different from the trait groups of structured-deme models, so that
structured-deme models can be used to demonstrate individual or group selection. By analyzing the models in terms of group neighbors, it has been shown that whenever trait groups are formed at random
only individual selection can act. The same results have emerged when there are no groups, only a continuous random array of individuals, and the analysis is in terms of neighborhoods. Individuals
exhibiting traits that can evolve under these conditions of neighborhood selection often impart some benefit to their neighbors. Such traits are said to be benevolent. Altruism involves a loss of
individual fitness and can evolve only by group selection. The evolution of altruism can be demonstrated in structured-deme models, provided that the altruists exhibit positive association and can
occur whether the population forms isolated groups or a continuous array. Structured-deme models are a valuable tool for analyzing local interactions and the resulting neighborhood selection; it is
important to note, however, that if a model incorporates isolated trait groups, then within-group comparisons are entirely inappropriate for evaluating the fate of genotypes. Comparing genotypes under
conditions of equivalent neighborhoods not only gives a direct indication of relative fitnesses, but also provides the unexpected bonus of making the analysis technically much easier.","Nunney, Len"

Each model was developed within
the framework of a specific situation: the salivation of a hungry dog receiving food in the presence of a distinctive stimulus and the escape of a hungry cat from a puzzle box to feed. The original
situations have been elaborated and diversified to account for the variety and complexity of the effects of experience on behavior, but the basic paradigms have remained unchanged. These models
present a reductionistic view of acquired behavior; that is, both assume that all learned behavior can be accounted for in terms of response strengthening, shaping, and chaining. Further, they assume
that responses, unconditioned stimuli, and reinforcers can be described in physical language' without recourse to psychological and biological meaning. These models are assumed to be universal,
holding for all instances of learning. They leave little room for the interaction of phylogeny with experience. Added to these models was the philosophy of the refinement experiment,* which argues
that simple laws are discovered by reducing to the minimum the number of response possibilities and environmental stimuli affecting the phenomenon under study. Thus, the situations in which classical
and instrumental conditioning were investigated were highly simplified and very different from those in which an animal might find itself in its niche. As a result investigators seldom asked to what
use the acquired skills might be put. The unquestioned assumption was that understanding behavior in simple situations would generalize to complex ones. Unfortunately, this has not proven to be the
case. One of the first of a number of threats to these assumptions was the discovery of conditioned taste aversions. Here, both the time parameters and the rules of association of classical
conditioning were violated. However, the usefulness of such a skill in an animal's avoidance of potentially noxious or toxic substances led to its eventual acceptance, even though this kind of
functional criterion had not previously been invoked in support of learning models. These findings led to the concept of biological constraints on learning.' An earlier threat to the classical models,
for the most part unnoticed, resulted from the work of the Brelands.4 They discovered that the conditionability of responses or response patterns was speciesand situation-specific. The strain on the
classical learning models was further increased by the discovery of autoshapings and species-specific defense reactions6 A potentially much greater challenge for classical models of learning, however,

climatic variables, and sympatry or allopatry of these species. Only erminea increases in size with latitude; it does so regardless of the presence or absence of frenata or nivalis. Latitude is a
better predictor of size in erminea than available measures of climate, seasonality or prey size. There is no evidence for character displacement between any pair of species. The sexes covary in size
in frenata and erminea, and probably in nivalis, although geographic variation in sexual dimorphism occurs in frenata and erminea. The principal cause of sexual dimorphism appears to be sexual
selection for large size in males rather than the high energetic requirements resulting from an elongate body shape. However, prey size may constrain female size (and possibly also male size).
Regional differences in the abundance of prey during the growth of young weasels may affect adult size much more in males than in females and contribute to geographic variation in sexual dimorphism.","Ralls, Katherine and Harvey, Paul H."

nests by two or more birds, egg-laying, incubation and brooding at one nest by one or more females, and nestling care by breeding and non-breeding birds. The form that breeding behavior takes may be
related to the ages of flock members. Flocks vary considerably in age, and breeding success is correlated with the number of older birds. The variation in Brown Jay breeding behavior may provide some
insight into the evolution of social organization in New World corvids. Several authors have suggested that habitat change or release from saturation may induce enormous changes in social structure
and behavior of cooperatively breeding birds (Brown and Balda 1977; Vehrencamp 1978; Stacey 1978, 1979a, b; Reyer 1980; Hardy et al. 1981). The most compelling arguments in favor of this hypothesis,
however, have resulted from comparative studies of separate populations either in different environments (Cox, unpubl.; Stacey 1978, 1979a, b; Reyer 1980; Koenig 1981) or in populations where habitat
quality varied conspicuously (at least to human eyes) over a small geographic area (Brown and Balda 1977, Vehrencamp 1978, Hardy et al. 1981). To date, information on the demographic and behavioral
effects of change in saturation within one population has been unavailable, in part because many researchers consider gross population manipulation (i.e., removing a significant portion of a
population or destroying habitat) unethical. Moreover, because the study of complex social behavior necessitates longterm investigation, most field workers seek study populations in the protected
environments of nature preserves. As a result, their study populations frequently exist under saturated conditions and do not fluctuate much from year to year. One way to investigate the effects of
saturation on social organization and behavior, however, is to study natural experiments by identifying and investigating populations that have recently been released from, or are rapidly approaching
saturation. For instance, in 1978, one of the world's best studied populations of cooperative breeders (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1984)-Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) on the Archbold
Biological Station in Florida-was decimated, probably by an epidemic (J. Fitzpatrick, pers. comm.). Because of the wealth of base line information available for this population, documenting changes in
behavior and social organization as the population recovers represents an ideal natural experiment. In this paper, we present the results of a twoyear study of Brown Jays (Cyanocorax morio) in a
population whose dynamics may also represent the naturally occurring experimental conditions necessary to test current notions of the relationship between habitat saturation and sociobiology. We
designed a study to address a series of a priori hypotheses concerning the role of helpers at the nest (Lawton and Lawton 1980, Lawton and Guindon 1981, Lawton and Lawton, unpubl.). In the course of
our work, we discovered that Brown Jay flocks in Monteverde are extraordinarily heterogeneous with respect to age-class composition. We think this heterogeneity may be attributed to the fact that the
population is still expanding after original colonization about thirty years ago (W. Guindon, pers. comm.), shortly after the highland plateau of Monteverde was cleared for dairy farming. Although
Monteverde has experienced no significant clearing since our study began, the number ofjays in our study area has increased twenty percent (Lawton, Lawton, Lewis, and Lowther, unpubl.). Population
growth is not simply the result of increased flock size, but derives from an increased number of flocks in the study area (1978: n = 14; 1982: n = 16). Growth is also reflected by expansion into new
habitat. Of two flocks formed since 1978, one has become established in the highest clearing in Monteverde, an area abutting a natural species border: the large, uninterrupted expanse of cloud forest.","Lawton, Marcy F. and Lawton, Robert O."

10,bergerud_aggressive_1985,Aggressive and {Spacing} {Behavior} of {Female} {Blue} {Grouse},1985-01-01,"-Female Blue Grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) on Stuart Island, Washington were found to interact aggressively with female dummies in the prelaying period when a taped cackle call was played.
Interactions included: tail fanning, wing dragging, everting the white patagium feathers to display a shoulder patch, head bobbing, neck stretching, jump attacking, pecking, and diving attacks.
Threatening and aggressive calls included: cackling calls with inflections, a Nee-uk call, and attack and scream whinny calls. The frequency of aggressive interactions was greatest in the latter half
of April, a period when hens were selecting nesting sites. The prelaying ranges of 12 hens were mostly mutually exclusive and showed a dispersed distribution relative to each other. However, there
were interspaces sufficient for other grouse to nest. We suggest that aggressive behavior and mutual avoidance of females resulted in a dispersed distribution of nest sites. Such spacing should
enhance the reproductive fitness of females by reducing predation rates on hens, eggs, and young. Received 24 August 1983, accepted 16 November 1984. THERE has been disagreement among biologists on
whether territoriality in birds primarily served to disperse the breeding population (Lack 1966, 1968), or whether, in addition to this spacing function, it regulated numbers by excluding some
individuals from securing breeding space (Wynne-Edwards 1962). Even after 20 years, the argument continues (Davies 1978, Patterson 1981, Wittenberger 1981). Recently, the territorial limitation
hypothesis has been expanded to include the mutual exclusion of yearling females by other females in polygynous Blue Grouse (Dendragapus obscurus; Zwickel 1972, 1980; Hannon and Zwickel 1979). The
primary evidence for surplus nonbreeding females was that, following the removal of localized females in the prelaying period, additional yearling females occupied the vacancies created (Zwickel 1972,
1980). However, this replacement does not constitute unequivocal evidence of socially induced nonbreeding in yearling females, since these females might have bred elsewhere (cf. Watson and Moss 1970).
The newcomers could have shifted their ranges to improve their fitness as proposed in the Fretwell-Lucas habitat model (Fretwell and Lucas 1969). Such redistribution is consistent with theoretical
considerations that animals should space themselves to reduce predation risk (Taylor 1976). The resolution of this perennial question requires documentation of the dispersion pattern of all females in
a population where emigration cannot confound results. We measured aggressiveness and described the distribution of female Blue Grouse on Stuart Island, Washington during the breeding cycle in 1975
and 1976. Our hypothesis was that social interactions between females in the prelaying period resulted in mutually spaced ranges but that the spacing and ensuing social interactions did not prevent
any female from nesting. Subordinate females could either nest between the ranges of other females or delay nesting until adults were egglaying and/or incubating their eggs.","Bergerud, A. T. and Butler, H. E."

In a comparison of two species of herons (Ardeidae) in a Texas colony,
great egret nestlings fought 18 times more often than adjacent great blue herons during the first month. Egret nestlings frequently killed the youngest of three or four siblings, but herons seldom
did. (The frequency estimates for siblicide in this egret population range from 18.8\% [32/145] in a census sample to 52.9\% [9/17] in nests subjected to close behavioral observation.) These
interspecific differences in siblicidal aggression seem related to the degree to which the limiting resource, food, is potentially monopolizable by the nestlings. Ardeid parents eat mostly fish, which
they transport to the nest internally (in crop and esophagus) and regurgitate for the young. The diet of Texas great egrets consisted almost entirely of very small individual fish that were delivered
to the chicks in discrete boluses. By the age of about 2 wk, elder chicks could intercept most boluses and thus monopolize the food. This monopolization was greatly enhanced by fighting and
intimidating younger siblings. By contrast, great blue heron prey tended to be too large for the young to intercept, which made effective monopolization much more difficult. A general hypothesis is
advanced, linking adaptive siblicidal aggression to delivered food size (specifically, monopolizability). Some of its predictions have withstood experimental testing (Mock 1984b) and it accounts well
for the known cases of siblicide in ardeids and other avian taxa.","Mock, Douglas W."

Chaffinch males began establishing
territories almost three weeks earlier than bramblings, but egg-laying took place at about the same time, viz. after mid-May. Chaffinch males dispersed singly to their territories, usually in familiar
areas. The territory serves as a food source and attracts the female. Brambling males move within loose displaying groups in a new area each spring. They disperse to the decisive breeding territory
only after pairing. The female selects the nest site. This means that chaffinch males control access to females by defending territory and brambling males more directly by defending the females. The
territorial system of the chaffinch develops earlier and less synchronously than that of the brambling. Fringilla males settling early clearly have a certain superiority in the competition for
territories. The asynchronous settling of chaffinches may be advantageous in the early spring when the food supply is scarce and variable. Simultaneous settling leads to a rapid and more synchronized
development of the reproductive activities. The time-saving mechanism at the onset of breeding in bramblings is a response to northern conditions. Sociality and time saving are favourable when the
available time for nesting is short and the abundant resources are unpredictable in space and time. Early settling may also extend time to accommodate renesting attempts following nest losses. In the
study area, chaffinches and bramblings nested in the same woods and their territories overlapped markedly. The establishment of breeding territories by them takes place in different ways. The species
differ from each other in respect of breeding dispersal, social tendency, mate and resource defences in relation to territory. This suggests that their reproductive tactics diverge.","Mikkonen, A. V."

the observed times. Stepwise multiple regressions showed that time of sunrise (or sunset) was the most important predictor of departure (or roosting) time, as expected, followed by light intensity and
then cloud cover. Temperature and relative humidity were statistically unimportant, except for one group (Group 51) at roosting, where humidity appeared to be a significant variable. However, humidity
was directly correlated with cloud cover and may thus have been only indirectly related to roosting. Group 51 roosted significantly earlier than Group 56, but tended to leave the roost earlier as
well. Therefore both groups were active for about the same length of time each day. Group 51 roosted earlier relative to sunset as the season progressed, whereas Group 56 showed no such tendency. The
observed differences between groups cannot reflect dif- ferent ecological factors, because the groups occupied physically similar adjacent home ranges. Instead, they suggest a random effect of social
behaviour on an otherwise straightforward set of responses.","Gill, B.J. and Dow, Douglas D."
70,murray_evolution_1985,Evolution of {Clutch} {Size} in {Tropical} {Species} of {Birds},1985-01-01,"The small size of clutches of tropical species of birds when compared with clutch sizes of related species at higher latitudes has been known for a long time. Several contending theories and their
variations have been proposed. The most prominent suggest that clutch size is determined by the amount of energy available to the parents for reproduction. Others propose that reproduction is adjusted
to the mortality rate, small clutches occurring in populations whose members are favored with long life expectancies. The theory supported in this paper was first proposed by R. E. Moreau. It states
that individuals may produce more offspring in a season or in a lifetime by reducing the number of chicks in a brood relative to the maximum number of young that could be reared under prevailing
conditions. The parents of larger broods have shorter life expectancies and, thus, produce fewer broods and, in the long run, fewer young. The development of these and several other minor hypotheses
is reviewed, and the theories are evaluated with respect to the data and arguments offered in their support. My version of Moreau's theory is most fully discussed and is applied to single-brooded
species with clutch sizes that vary geographically (e.g., phasianids), single-brooded species without geographic variation (e.g., procellariiforms), multibrooded species with geographic variation
(e.g., many passerine species), and multibrooded species without geographic variation (e.g., doves and hummingbirds). The patterns of variation in these groups are consistent with Moreau's theory,
although available information is scanty, especially with regard to the life expectancies of birds and to the number of broods produced in a breeding season. The theory seems to offer explanations for
several lingering problems: (a) Ricklefs' observation that clutch size variation is surprisingly similar among species having widely different foraging behaviors and occupying habitats varying as much
as 10fold in productivity, (b) the similarity in clutch sizes in species with uniparental care and related species with biparental care, (c) the greater clutch sizes at higher latitudes of populations
of nocturnal species, and (d) the evolution of populations whose clutch sizes are contrary to the general trend. The theoretical argument suggests that patterns of clutch size variation cannot be
understood without considering differences in survivorship schedules, ages of first and last reproduction, and the number of broods reared by parents during the breeding season. The need for research
on these life history parameters is urged. RESUMEN. Por largo tiempo se ha sabido que las nidadas (""clutch"") de las especies de aves tropicales son mas pequena que las nidadas de las especies

Contrary to what we should expect from the theory of maximum reproductionthat birds rear as many young as they can adequately nourishunaided females commonly have broods as large as those attended by
both parents, sometimes with helpers. Failure to find consistent correlation between clutch size and number of nest attendants, diet, habitat, or type of nest (other than the well-known tendency of
hole-nesters to rear larger broods) leads us to seek some factor, or factors, that profoundly influence the reproduction of most birds of the humid neotropics. Not to be neglected is the high
percentage of nest failures, greater in forest than in neighboring clearings and plantations, and greater at low than at high elevations. Available evidence leaves the effect of human visits on nest
losses uncertain; hatching failure due to infertility, faulty incubation, or other intrinsic factors appears to be no greater in the tropics than at higher latitudes; predation is certainly
responsible for most losses. The major factor responsible for the small clutches of tropical birds of many kinds appears to be, as Cody and Ricklefs have argued, the less strongly contrasting seasons
of the humid tropicsa measure of which is the annual march of evapotranspirationas compared with northern lands. The restrained reproductive effort of tropical birds is adjusted to their low annual
mortality in a climate that does not force birds to confront a season of scarcity and stress unless they undertake hazardous migrations. Moreover, the high incidence of predation on nests makes it
advantageous to limit the energy expended on a brood, so that, if this fails, strength remains for repeated trials. Also, the smaller the brood, the fewer the feeding visits that may reveal the nest's
location to predators. Because ornithology was born in the north temperate zone where broods tend to be large, we ask why the broods of tropical birds are so small. If more ornithologists had grown up
in the tropics, we would be asking why birds at high latitudes lay so many eggsa question easier to answer. RESUMEN. Un estudio del tamano de las nidadas de 217 especies de passeriformes de las
regiones humedas neotropicales, muestra que el numero prevaleciente de huevos en una nidada es dos; siendo menos frecuentes nidadas de uno o tres huevos y son raras las nidadas mas grandes.

displacing the owners, or by repeatedly visiting the same area and establishing a territory of their own, usually on territory boundaries where resistance from established birds was least. About 30\%

In order for a species to survive, two major drives must exist in its members: (1) a drive for
survival of the individual and (2) a drive for propagation of the species. Personal survival requires maintenance activities such as eating and drinking, as well as taking precautions against being
destroyed by predators or unfavourable environmental conditions. At first glance these activities seem to operate within an individual which presumably takes appropriate action to alleviate unpleasant
internal stimuli of hunger or thirst, or external stimuli such as heat or cold. Indeed most studies of the physiological mechanisms which regulate these homeostatic behaviours have concentrated on the
stimulus-response sequence within an individual. On second thought it becomes obvious that social factors are also involved. Young animals must learn which foods are edible, where and how they can be
obtained, and how predators may be recognized and avoided. As adults, individuals may cooperate in hunting, foraging, and warning of danger, or alternately, compete for food either directly or
indirectly through competition for territory or a position in the social hierarchy.","Swanson, H. H."

Long-term changes in the population biology are presented for the history of the
colony (1949 to 1984).Mortality rates of adults were particularly high in the early 1970's; concurrently recruitment rates increased, age of first breeding declined, and the body weights of recruits
decreased in order to compensate. A model of colony growth is presented which shows that small colonies are proportionately more attractive to recruits in that they have higher rates of increase and
recruitment. The North Shields colony followed the expected pattern of growth for 17 years. Evidence presented shows that nest sites at North Shields were then socially limited; there were physically
available sites which were not used. In consequence of the social structure of the colony, there was a pool of potential recruits which were temporarily restricted from breeding. Recruits (Kittiwakes
breeding for the first time) were at least three years old, were present at the colony as prospectors in at least one year prior to breeding, and arrived by early May in the year of first breeding.
The attendance of recruits at the colony in May was more than three times that of prospectors, and recruits had higher body weights. These prerequisites separated recruits from prospectors, but there
was further selection at the time of recruitment. Kittiwakes preferred to nest as close as possible to other nesting pairs, but aggression forced a compromise. High quality birds chose sites close to
other birds and did better reproductively. Thus individual quality segregated recruits on the basis of their ability to compete for sites in dense areas; some Kittiwakes deliberately waited for
aggression from established breeders to decline in order to take up preferred sites. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of the buffering effect of the pool of non-breeders on the
size of the breeding group, and individual differences in quality.","Porter, J."

dominant mechanism by which the quality of the Tsembaga ecosystem is maintained. In this paper, we demonstrate that the pig festival cannot serve this function. Simulation models of the Tsembaga
ecosystem show that a stable, self-regulating equilibrium of the kind proposed by Rappaport is highly dependent upon a carefully chosen set of parameters which do not represent the most accurate
choice from the available data. In the simulation model of Rappaport's hypothesis constructed by Shantzis and Behrens, equilibrium depends upon fixed population growth rates that lead to regularly
scheduled pig festivals, whose timing insures that a fixed rate of removal of Tsembaga individuals in warfare prevents net population growth. More realistic models uniformly suggest that the pig
festival plays no essential role in ecosystem regulation. We conclude that the evidence provided does not support the hypothesis.","Foin, Theodore C. and Davis, William G."

with broods, a situation suggesting that more yearlings lost their eggs or young and did not renest. Pairs composed of two adults produced more fledged young than did pairs composed of two yearlings,
but clutch size and date of clutch initiation were similar in the two groups. We suggest that the following factors may allow yearlings to reproduce almost as successfully as adults: (1) a reduction
in competition with adults for territories because of high population turnover, (2) the presence of extensive male parental care and precocial young, and (3) a dependence on a food source that is
readily available and can be obtained without specialized foraging skills.","Hannon, Susan J. and Smith, James N. M."

because intraspecific competition for food close to the colony would result in prey depletion, causing adults to travel increasing distances for food as colony size increased.Breeding numbers could be
regulated through a density-dependent reduction in reproductive output resulting from reduced rates of provisioning of chicks. This mechanism may not apply to seabird colonies in higher latitudes,
however, because seasonal production might provide superabundant food supplies during the breeding season. Recent studies of the quantity of food consumed by breeding seabirds12–15 suggest that prey
depletion also occurs in temperate regions and invites a critical test of Ashmole's hypothesis. We present here an analysis of interactions between spatial distribution and size of seabird breeding
colonies and provide support for Ashmole's suggestion that seabird numbers may be limited by intraspecific competition for food around colonies during the breeding season.","Furness, R. W. and Birkhead, T. R."

The year 1982, the centenary of Charles Darwin's death, witnessed conferences, symposia, and publications in many disciplines devoted to reassessing the theory of evolution by natural selection and
all its ramifications. A brief historical review on developments in evolutionary theory emphasizing the role of mathematics is given in §3 of this paper. §2 presents background material on agents of
evolutionary processes. §4 contains an annotated listing of several problems and controversies pertaining to evolutionary processes, and a more extended discussion of the neutralist-selectionist
controversy. §5 presents background information relating to sex ratio in various plant and animal species. Several classes of mathematical models of much recent interest centering on sex ratio
evolution and related dynamical systems are examined in §§6-8; the purely mathematically oriented reader can pass directly to these sections. The concluding section presents our views on several
philosophic issues in evolutionary theory today, and on the nature of the mathematics relevant to the genetics of the current decade. Taxonomists have recorded 1-2 million plant and animal species and
surmise that another 4-6 million species remain to be classified. More than 50\% of all living species are of the insect genera; the Drosophila flies alone comprise at least 2,500 species. Counts of
bird species vary from 8,000 to 10,000. The number of species from the evolution of life to the present is estimated at 4-16 billion. Simpson (1953) projects that more than 99.9\% of all species that
ever existed are extinct. The ubiquitous variability within species of biochemical, morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits is also intriguing. As observation, and experimental techniques
are being refined, increasing numbers of segregating genes (those exhibiting at least two alternative types) are being detected. Another aspect of nonuniformity is the prodigious variety of sexual
mechanisms, mating patterns, life cycles, life styles, strategies for survival and reproduction, growth characteristics, and ecosystem interactions. Concomitant to the observed diversity in living
forms and life patterns, there are some universals and expressions of identity. The basic DNA-RNA structure and its replication mechanism are present in ""all"" organisms. Proteins","Karlin, Samuel"

cool, and constant cool groups. These data were evaluated in relation to vertical migrations of fish to test the physiological enhancements that may be important to vertical migrations. Apparently
thermocycles allow more rapid consumption of food than constant cool conditions and lower metabolic rates than constant warm conditions, which allows some fish to grow more rapidly under thermocycles

Beaver maximize the net rate
of energy acquisition (e/t) when they minimize the distance travelled from the lodge, their central place, while obtaining a balanced diet. However, beaver must travel through two mediums to obtain
terrestrial forage so minimum distance is a function of the relative costs of swimming and walking. A continuum of relative costs was used to generate two contrasting foraging models: 1) swimming
equalled the cost of walking and the foraging path was a straight line from the lodge to a tree; 2) swimming was costless and the foraging path was the shortest distance from water to a tree. The
models were compared for relative goodness of fit with the observed foraging pattern using chi-square and linear regression goodness of fit tests. The water costless model was the best fit model and
empirically supported the implicit assumption of most workers that the pond is the effective central place. In practical terms 'water costless* was judged to be indistinguishable from a 5-10 times
advantage for swimming over walking. Although experimental confirmation is required, this advantage was considered too large to be explained by energy or time savings and was therefore not an
optimization of e/t. It was tentatively concluded that the pond should be viewed as a refuge from predators which probably constrain the relative availability of terrestrial forage to beaver. A test
for optimal foraging, given the predation constraint, showed that beaver were maximizing e/t at Northbranch Pond. At Pinetop Pond, a relatively old site, beaver expanded their refuge to obtain patches
of relatively high food quality. They could have realized higher e/t with perfect knowledge of their site, but apparently they maximized e/t with a patch use strategy that minimized search time. A
review of beaver literature discussed optimization processes at four levels: evolution of body form and function, the individual lifespan, yearly, and seasonally. Arguments of particular interest were
developed for dispersal (population regulation), central place, and the sizedistance relationship.","Dalton, W."

to another only at the surface. Each population was observed on 2-4 occasions, making a combined total of 50 observation periods of 2 hours each. Chase-right orders, spatial positions as well as
several agonistic and epigamic behaviour units were noted during each period of observation. Males and females apparently form distinct hierarchies which are perfectly linear and transitive in 68\%
and 42\% of the cases respectively. Some dominance structures are incomplete, but no intransitivity is noted. Alpha males are much more aggressive than their isosexual subordinates. In females, the
frequency of aggressive behaviour appears to be more proportional to the social rank of the initiator, but the number of chases received from other females is the best indicator of rank in the female
hierarchies. Alpha males are responsible for 80 \% of all sexual activity and have privilege to behaviour leading to insemination with a high probability in 85 \% of the cases. Females are not courted
according to their position in the female hierarchy, nor to their size. In the two-compartment situation of the present study, which allowed spacing-out and visual isolation of the individuals, the
alpha males occupied the larger area of the aquarium in the company of the four females while the three subordinate males were restricted to the smaller area, unaccompanied by any females. This
spacing-out pattern emerged with neat regularity from the data and was apparently caused and maintained by aggressive behaviour, especially by charges, initiated by the alpha male toward male rivals.
However, it is not evident that the behaviour of the alpha male should be neatly qualified as territorial defence, since specific-area-linked dominance was never realized in the present study. The
social scheme most readily applicable to the present social and spatial organization is the ""one male to several females"" system or monarchistic male hierarchy, in which one male becomes very dominant
over the others, occupies the larger area and is also the sole individual to court the females and to attempt insemination (haremic). These results support the sociobiological theorem that to dominate
is to have priority of access to the necessities of life and reproduction.","Beaugrand, Jacques P. and Caron, Jean and Comeau, Louise"
71,pollock_population_1983,Population {Viscosity} and {Kin} {Selection},1983-01-01,"Kin selection may be broken down into two components: intrafamily and interfamily selection. When an altruism coding allele is rare (i.e., at its emergence) within the family the frequency of the
altruism coding genotype necessarily declines; it is only by differential production of reproductives between families that kin selection can act to increase the frequency of this genotype in the
population. Thus kin selection acts on a partitioned population: families with altruists disperse more offspring than families without altruists. This has implications for current theories on the
evolution of eusociality, especially with respect to the role of population viscosity. In an environment with limited resources, population viscosity, by preventing offspring dispersal, creates a
population structure where, locally, the proportion of altruism coded genotypes is declining. If the population is at carrying capacity, and if survivorship is unrelated to altruistic genotype, over
generations fewer of this genotype survive to reproduce. In effect, continual population viscosity disrupts kin selection. This suggests that theories which invoke population viscosity to provide high
values of r are wanting. In particular, contrary to the polygynous family hypothesis (see text), kin selection in the presence of population viscosity cannot yield evolutionarily stable semisociality.
Rather, effective kin selection requires parental mediation to form temporary groups of related conspecifics. Thus explanations invoking kin selection must ultimately focus on the parent.","Pollock, Gregory B."

Among human pregnancies alone, over 50 per cent fail between conception and parturition, and the majority of
these failures are unexplained. These findings present important problems for evolutionary theory as well as for health care practices. This paper addresses these high rates of reproductive failure
among mammals, by extending the work of a number of evolutionary biologists regarding the reproductive consequences of environmental adversity. The basic model upon which we elaborate, termed the
Reproductive Suppression Model, argues that females can optimize their lifetime reproductive success by suppressing reproduction when future conditions for the survival of offspring are likely to be
sufficiently better than present ones as to exceed the costs of the suppression itself. These costs are a function of reproductive time lost and the direct phenotypic effects of the suppression
itself. To evaluate the benefits and costs of suppression, the following types of cues should be assessed: the female's physical and mental health, her stage of reproduction, the physical and genetic
status of her offspring, and the external conditions at the time of birth. We also examine various issues of social suppression, whereby the conditions for survival of offspring are a function of the
reproduction and support of other group members. Under such conditions, some females may be able to improve current conditions for reproduction by suppressing the reproduction of others. Field data
from our own work are presented, describing socially mediated reproductive competition among continuously breeding female yellow baboons and among female hoary marmots. Social suppression in other
mammals is also evaluated, including that in human beings, and we conclude with some implications of the Reproductive Suppression Model for sexual selection theory regarding female-female reproductive
competition, as well as human health care.","Wasser, Samuel K. and Barash, David P."

selection was discredited. The fatal blow came, not from a crucial experiment, or even from a new theoretical development, but simply from the elegance and clarity of Williams's thought in
interpreting developments of the previous three decades. For the next decade, group selection rivaled Lamarkianism as the most thoroughly repudiated idea in evolutionary theory. Then it mysteriously
rose from the dead. The modem version of group selection is supported by a variety of internally consistent and biologically plausible models. M. J. Wade and his associates (23, 59, 75, 76, 81) claim

function’ approach to modelling the theory of kin selection. The components of the model involve: (a) the delineation of the basic group structure specifying individual relationships; (b) the
specification of local fitness functions that depend on group composition; (c) the determination of average fitness functions for the different phenotypes with respect to the population at large. We
then derive a pair of benefit and cost functions, which are functions of the group composition and the numbers of altruist and selfish phenotypes. In this new framework the quantitative validity of
the Hamilton criterion for the evolution of altruism are assessed and reinterpreted.","Karlin, Samuel and Matessi, C."

paired females increased slowly to 90\% in April. Bill threats were the predominant agonistic display of Gadwalls, accounting for 89\% of all observations, while chasing (5.8\%) and biting (5.2\%)
accounted for the remainder. Nearly all (91.1\%) conflicts involved birds that had been feeding before the dispute. On average, Gadwalls spent 0.4\% of their time in agonistic activities. Gadwalls
preferred to associate with individuals of similar pair status. Paired Gadwalls were more likely to threaten other paired birds, and unpaired Gadwalls other unpaired birds, than they would individuals
of the other pair status. Only 14\% of disputes involving Gadwalls were with other Anatinae. Pairs were considered dominant over unpaired birds, as pairs won 81\% (P {\textless} 0.001) of contests
with unpaired birds. This study suggested that paired birds, because of their dominance, probably had greater access to preferred food resources and were more successful in meeting nutrient
requirements than were unpaired birds. It also suggested that pairing chronology in Anatinae may be related to food choice and foraging strategies, those species feeding on poorer-quality foods
forming pairs earlier, as individuals attempt to optimize their allocation of time for feeding and other activities.","Paulus, Stuart L."

adaptive interaction of culture and environment—is less traditional, because influenced by developments in modern biology. The influences were less conspicuous in human ecology's antecedents. In
Britain, C D . Forde had worked since the 1930s to legitimize the study of ""habitat"" and society after the unfortunate excesses of various geographical determinists. His model did not incorporate the
biological concept of adaptation as such, and remained generally consistent with British anthropology's Durkheimian tendency to treat ""social facts"" as product of other social facts. Julian Steward's
work in American anthropology brought a much more self-consciously adaptive program to ecological anthropology. Steward spoke of the ""adaptive interaction"" of a techno-productive ""culture core"" and
the biophysical environment. It is their interaction, he suggested, which explains the general fit between culture and environment. Although it focused on the natural environment, his model tended to

describing the elementary processes of natural selection as an existential game where the maintenance ability of each individual is separately tested by the environment, and (3) comparing persistence
and abundance measures of fitness. The tactics minimizing the risk that the individual dies without leaving surviving progeny are feasible short-term tactics in the existential game whether or not
they maximize the numerical contribution to future generations. Maximizing abundance measures of fitness is not the primary long-term strategy in evolution. The tactics with the highest short-term
reproductive success in one generation do not necessarily, in the long run, allow the continuation of the existential game through generations in fluctuating environments. The role of natural
selection in the evolution of defence tactics of trees is discussed on this theoretical basis. From the functional viewpoint, trees are individual self-maintaining units in which reproduction may be
decentralized to a number of sub-units organized around the same maintenance system. Defence mechanisms in such organizations can, in principle, evolve under selection between and/or within individual
trees. They can evolve also under negative mass selection during periodical outbreaks of herbivores. In such cases, rare events instead of adaptation to the average environment are driving forces of
evolutionary change.","Tuomi, Juha and Salo, Jukka and Haukioja, Erkki and Niemelä, Pekka and Hakala, Tuomo and Mannila, Rauno and Niemela, Pekka"

The argument is sometimes made that selection can only act on an
ideal hypercycle as a unit and that it tends to eliminate all but the most faithfully reproducing hypercycles. Alternatively, it could be stated that the most faithfully reproducing hypercycle is of
necessity the strongest basin of attraction, though internal variation and selection processes involving individual species (the constituent cycles) could not realistically be eliminated as potential
sources of destabilization. These two points of view reflect the dual contributions of ecological and evolutionary stability to ecosystem succession and evolution. Hypercycles, insofar as they are
exemplified by ecosystems, cannot exclude selection on individual species, as sometimes claimed on the basis of studies of idealized hypercycles. But at the same time these studies suggest that the
global constraints imposed on individual species in an ecosystem are much more powerful than those which could be deduced from classical population dynamics models, a consideration which should be
incorporated into thinking about ecosystem organization. 12.4. ENVIRONMENTAL HOMEOSTASIS While the naive thermodynamic analogy is inevitably somewhat wobbly, the connection to adaptability theory may
be formalized in a useful way. The equivalence class of compatible descriptions corresponds to the hierarchy of adaptive, informational, macroscopic, and microscopic equivalence classes described in
Table 4.1. It is connected to behavioral uncertainty. The effectiveness of the constraints is measured by the anticipation and indifference terms. The tendency of adaptability is determined by the
evolutionary and dynamic considerations described above. But the minimal tendency should dominate, as evolutionary pressures would always eliminate superfluous constraint (e.g., would eliminate
superfluous ability to anticipate), while dynamical considerations suggest that superfluous constraint would always be exchanged for a larger equivalence class of compatible descriptions. The
adaptability theory formalization is again suggested by considering features of the microcosm experiment. The physical environment is divided into two parts, that inside the flask and that outside.
The outside part is completely outside the control of the organisms within. But the inside part is not. For any particular organism or population there is also a biotic component of the environment
which it may influence. This distinction between inexorable and exorable parts of the environment is quite appropriate for the world at large, though with some roughening. Events in ORGANIZATION AND
SUCCESSION OF ECOSYSTEMS 291 space, such as radiation from supernovas, influence life, but are not influenced by it; the vagaries of weather, even if influenced by the development of life on earth,
are still vagaries. But the concentrations of carbon, phosphorus, water, and other materials are largely determined by the activities of organisms. There are two forms of control which can be exerted
on these features: 1. The diversity of community states may be increased (cf. Section 4.10). This exerts control if the increase reflects the incorporation of mechanisms which cycle materials or
otherwise repair the environment. This does not reduce environmental uncertainty. Even if there is no cycle the environment may change in an entirely determinate way. But creating cycles increases the
ability of the community to anticipate the environment and decreases undesirable indifference. It decreases the uncertainty of the environment from the point of view of the community. Cycling does not
necessarily decrease the diversity of the environment states, but it generally does so. Insofar as it is controllable, the cycle of environmental states can in principle be contracted to a single
state if the diversity of community states is made high enough. 2. The community may use its adaptability to buffer the controllable environment from the uncertain perturbations of the uncontrollable
environment. Here the community may be thought of as internalizing part of the environment and then making this internalized environment an object of control. Originally its adaptability had to exceed
the uncertainty of both the controllable and uncontrollable environment. But after internalization the adaptability is increased and the controllable uncertainty is decreased. This contradicts the
evolutionary tendency for superfluous adaptability to decrease, but the advantage of internalization outweighs this. When the internalization phase comes to an end, the excess adaptability can decline
without resulting in an increase in the uncertainty of the controllable part of the environment. There are many examples of such internalization: the environment inside the nest, the beaver's dam, the
human home. At one time in the ancient past the present day internal milieu may have been an internalized environment, such as regulated sea water in a body cavity. To make this buffering argument
precise it is convenient to write","Calow, Peter and Conrad, M."

empirical evidence. The hypothesis that life-history does not evolve is rejected on the grounds that life-history can be readily modified by artifical selection. The hypothesis that life-history
evolves according to mechanisms other than natural selection acting on genetic variation is shown to have no sound experimental basis. The hypothesis that life-history evolution depends primarily on
group selection is undermined by the absence of the predicted group adaptations. The hypothesis that life-history is a unitary character which evolves in the same fashion as fitness is rejected
because of the disparity between life-history genetics and basic theory concerning the evolution of fitness. The hypothesis that life-history is composed of a set of autonomous characters which are
subject to mutation accumulation at later ages is refuted by the lack of any detectable increase in genetic variability with age and the evidence for the interdependence of lifehistory characters. It
is concluded that the hypothesis of antagonistic interactions between life-history characters, generalized to take genetic variability into account, is the most satisfactory theory of life-history
evolution available.","Rose, Michael R."

O. Wilson’s justly canonized Sociobiology: The New Synthesis
(1975), the subject is still beset by controversy and confusion. It is not at all clear exactly what the content is of sociobiological theory. Nor is it evident whether sociobiology constitutes a
radical break with traditional inquiries into behavior in such fields as ethology and comparative psychology, or, is merely an extension of the models and approaches used in these fields. Nor is there
yet much agreement over the implications of sociobiological theorizing for understanding human behavior in general, and, in particular, those moral and sociopolitical activities which are often cited
(Sahlins, 1976) as paradigmatic examples of humankind’s freedom from biological limits and constraints. Thus, this essay will have three major if somewhat immodest aims. First, the basic tenets of
what I will refer to as the “old” and “new” sociobiology will be presented and discussed. Second, a critical assessment will be made of the “new” sociobiology. And, finally, some effort will be made
to explain why sociobiological theorizing has been and continues to be a source of controversy by examining the implications of current sociobiological theorizing for morality.","Caplan, Arthur L."

individual must win in contests or comparisons with conspecific rivals in order to gain access to some resource, including (under sexual selection) mates. Sexual selection theory is extended to
encompass social competition for resources other than mates. Characters used in social competition can undergo particularly rapid and divergent evolution owing to (1) their great importance in
determining access to critical resources, (2) the absence of a limit to change (except by selection in other contexts), (3) the generation-to-generation relentlessness of selection on these traits,
(4) the potential for mutually accelerating evolution of preference and attractiveness in contests involving ""choice, ""and (5) the very large number offactors that can initiate trends, including
mutation and drift leading to use of different physiological or behavioral characteristics as signals, the role of novelty per se in the evolution of combat and display, ecological or habitat
differences influencing the form of combat and of signals, and (in species capable of learning) imitation of idiosyncratic characteristics of successful individuals. Many species-specific signals
heretofore attributed to selection for species recognition (""isolating mechanisms') are probably instead products of social selection. This may help explain the rarity of reproductive character
displacement and other phenomena predicted by the species recognition hypothesis. Examplesfrom a wide variety of organisms illustrate patterns predicted by social selection theory, including (1)
exaggeration and rapid divergence of traits (e.g., weapons, pheromones, plumage, flowers, and song) used in social competition, (2) a correlation between type of social system (intensity of social
selection) and distinctiveness and exaggeration of social traits, (3) sexually monomorphic extreme development of socially selected traits when both sexes compete socially, (4) occurrence of
distinctive signals in allopatric populations lacking sympatric congeners, and (5) more rapid divergence (less phylogenetic conservatism) of socially competitive compared to non-competitive signals.
Rapid divergence under social selection may accelerate speciation due to effects on pre-mating interactions, as well as on critical social determinants of survival and reproductive success which would
put hybrids at a disadvantage. Maintenance of parapatric boundaries (extensive contact with little or no geographic overlap) between socially selected species may sometimes be due to competitive
exclusion in sympatry between populations whose primary divergence has been social rather than ecological. Patterns of variation in socially selected characters demonstrate the wisdom of Darwin's
distinction between natural and sexual selection, and the applicability of sexual selection theory to social competition in general.","West-Eberhard, M."

Gray did not exactly ‘age’ though to admit that he certainly grew older. We obviously need a word for mere ageing, and I propose to use ‘ageing’ itself for just that purpose. ‘Ageing’ hereafter stands
for mere ageing, and has no other innuendo. I shall use the word ‘senescence’ to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of bodily faculties and sensibilities and energies which ageing colloquially

estimating the extent of mixing of individuals within a species's range. There were major disagreements about how far young birds dispersed. Some authors felt that young birds did not tend to return
to their birthplaces (101) but selected a nesting site anywhere within the species's natural range (27, 81). Others concluded that birds attempting to breed for the first time did, on the whole,
return to their birthplaces though the extent of this fidelty was less than that of adults to their previous breeding sites (36, 69, 70, 91). It was generally agreed that adult birds did return to a
previous breeding place. Gradually the position of the supporters of the random dispersal theory was undermined as more data accumulated and methodological problems of measuring dispersal came to be
better appreciated. A number of longterm studies were reported between the late 1930s and the early 1950s (4,","Greenwood, P J and Harvey, P H"

An assumption made was that reproductive patterns among

onset for males and an accumulation of wives by older males. The model proposes that paternal frailty occasions the demise of paternal assets to male heirs, which translates into an earlier
reproductive onset for those heirs. Quantification of the model demonstrates its potentiality to account for the spread of genes for frailty through kin selection. ,  RÉSUMÉ Présentation d'un modèle

122,flinn_culture_1982,Culture theory: {The} developing synthesis from biology,1982-01-01,"ConclusionsWe believe that a useful, complete theory of culture is simpler than the dichotomies promoted by the coevolutionary approach suggest. Culture can be regarded as an aspect of the environment
into which each human is born and must succeed or fail, developed gradually by the succession of humans who have lived throughout history. We hypothesize that culture results from the inclusive-
fitness-maximizing efforts of all humans who have lived. We think the evidence suggests that cultural traits are, in general, vehicles of genic survival, and that the heritability of cultural traits
depends on the judgments (conscious and unconscious) of individuals with regard to their effects on the individual's inclusive fitness.The challenge now before students of culture is to understand the
proximate mechanisms, especially the ontogeny of learning biases, that result in the acquisition and transmission of cultural traits. How, for example, do we learn what constitutes an appropriate
return on a social investment in different circumstances; i.e., what causes us to feel rewarded by, say, helping offspring who do not help us back, yet consistently to begrudge lesser expenditures to
most others, or to feel cheated if we are not compensated for such expenditures immediately? We suggest that the answers to such questions lie in a few basic evolved learning tendencies.","Flinn, Mark V. and Alexander, Richard D."

environment. If a behavior is assumed to exist because of its social or ecological function, the problem is to show how individuals come to behave in group-advantageous ways. If a behavior is assumed
to exist because of its advantages for individuals, the problem is to explain how a social structure or a system of adaptation persists when individuals are usually hedonistic. A possible solution is
proposed through an examination of the Maring ritual cycle. The inadequacies of the group-advantage interpretation are summarized, and a model based upon individual advantage is presented: the ritual
cycle is a means by which individuals reciprocate the military services of allies. This interpretation may be incomplete: military help is a public good, but since its costs accrue differentially to
individuals the payments may be less than optimal for the survival of the group, and in this event natural selection eliminates groups that fail to compensate their allies. Individual and group
advantage may be complementary explanations of cooperation if the benefits are public goods.","Peoples, James G."

of fledging success. Once the birds are constrained to a breeding area, a weak relationship exists between large scale indices of anchovy abundance in the Southern California Bight (about 105 kM2) and
mean pelican fledging rates. This relationship becomes much stronger if pelican feeding behavior and more localized areas associated with their breeding colonies (about 8 x 103 kM2) are considered
separately. Anchovy abundance over small areas (about 2 x 103 km2) showed no relationship to pelican reproduction. This suggests that events which influence large geographic areas (such as weather-
patterns) affect reproduction through prey levels. Yet, pelican reproductive output is more precisely related to local aspects of prey availability and abundance. Fledging rates are a suitable
indicator of local food conditions because pelicans are constrained to more local feeding areas during breeding. High levels of annual variation in food supply result in high annual variations in
pelican reproductive performance. Anchovy densities are greater near the two island areas where pelicans most commonly breed than mean density over the entire Southern California Bight. Other regions
of high density in prey also exist during the pelican breeding season but they are probably not available to breeders. The locations of traditional breeding colonies most likely represent
environmental situations where the combination of nesting substrate and attainable food supplies occur together with consistency.","Anderson, Daniel W. and Gress, Franklin and Mais, Kenneth F."

1978). Gulls nesting in three different habitats (designated puffin, rocky, and mead- ow) were compared with regard to several reproductive parameters. More pairs were found to nest in rocky habitat,
and fewer pairs were found to nest in puffin habitat, than would be expected from a random distribution. In 1977, a year of low food availability, pairs in rocky habitat laid and hatched eggs
significantly earlier than in the other two habitats. In 1978, when food was more abundant, gulls in rocky habitat laid heavier eggs than their counterparts in the other habitats. In both 1977 and
1978, chicks from rocky habitat grew at the fastest rate and were heavier than chicks in the other habitats. Finally, results of an experiment to test the egg-production capacity of females
demonstrated that female gulls in rocky habitat were capable of producing significantly more eggs than their counterparts in meadow and puffin habitats. Despite the apparently better condition of
gulls in rocky habitat, however, Herring Gull pairs in puffin habitat fledged as many chicks per nest as pairs in rocky habitat in 1977 and 1978, and even fledged more chicks in 1976. In all 3 yr of
study, gulls in meadow habitat fledged the fewest chicks per nest. Within habitats, chick survival was strongly correlated with early laying dates and high rates of growth. However, there was also a
large residual effect which was probably due to differences in the habitats. These differences are probably due to crowding and socially induced mortality in rocky habitat, and to the presence of
predatory Great Black-backed Gulls in meadow habitat. The results support the theoretical models for habitat selection and dispersion developed by Fretwell and Lucas (1970), which suggest that
increasing density in a preferred habitat can create a situation whereby fitness may actually be greater in a less-preferred habitat.","Pierotti, Raymond"

The experiments were designed to
examine, via perturbations of food supply and/or population density, the relationship between home range size, food availability, and population density. When food levels were increased within an
area, a simultaneous effect was noted: mean home range size decreased and population density increased through recruitment from neighboring habitats. Whether the cause of the decreased patterns of
movement was the increased food supply or the elevated population density was deter- mined in subsequent experiments. When population density was held constant and food supplies were experimentally
increased, there was a significant reduction in mean home range sizes when compared to the normal (control) situation. When food supplies were undisturbed, but population density was greatly reduced,
there was no change in the mean home range size over that determined at higher densities. Our results suggest that, in eastern chipmunks, food supply is a primary determinant of mean home range size,
whereas population density, at least at the levels we examined experimentally, has no effect on movement patterns. These results are in accord with those theories relating movement patterns to
resource abundance, but are not in accord with hypotheses suggesting that home range sizes and population density are inversely associated.","Mares, Michael A. and Lacher, Thomas E. and Willig, Michael R. and Bitar, Nancy A. and Adams, Richard and Klinger, Alan and Tazik, David"

It dates back to A. R. Wallace,
and is accepted in principal by many paleontologists. The theory of selective extinction embodies the concept that species are units which are subject to differential or selective failure resulting in
extinction. The probability of extinction differs among species, because it is dependent, in large part, on the characteristics of species rather than being a totally random process. Similarly the
rates at which new species are produced are nonrandom and depend, in part, upon the nature of the species; some types undergo speciation more readily than others. Patterns such as the abundance of
r-selected species relative to K-selected species are thus a result of the balance struck between the rates of extinction and speciation, each of which varies along the continuum of life history
traits. In similar fashion, the theory of selective extinction provides a common, although not singular, explanation for such things as the common occurrence of sexual reproduction and the patterns
observed in species diversity as related to habitat size (e.g., island size). Although a few ecologists accept the paradigm of selective extinction (and some, such as those involved in island
biogeographic work, actually apply it), ecological thinking is in need of more interdisciplinary exchange with paleontological work. Resistance to the incorporation of selective extinction theory in
ecological work needs to be overcome by the realization that the theory of evolution and the theory of selective extinction are complementary rather than competitive. Finally, we do not imply in any
of our discussion that the effects of selective extinction offer the only explanation for patterns observed in nature. Rather, our emphasis is that selective extinction, synergistically or
antagonistically interacts with many other processes to produce community and ecosystem patterns.","Fowler, Charles W. and MacMahon, James A."

Experimental research on pathological processes (conceived as increased mortality and decreased fertility) has been conducted on a wide range of non-human populations. In a classic
study, Pearl (1925: 131-141) demonstrated that higher densities resulted in reduced fertility in Drosophila populations. Calhoun’s (1962) widely-cited study of density and pathology among Norwegian
white rats indicated that density led to decreased fertility and higher infant mortality (in some cases being 96 per cent) because of the lack of care given to the young. Other populations, for which
similar results have been found, include the flour beetle and grain weevil (Maclagan, 1932), guppies (Wynne-Edwards, 1962), lemmings and wild rats (Carstairs, 1969; Deevy, 1959), laboratory mice
(Chipman et al. , 1966), and crabs and the stickleback (Hall, 1966: 15-16; Tinbergen, 1952). A more penetrating literature also indicates the mechanisms that appear to bring this process about. For
newborn mice, Mirone et al. (1948) found that infant mortality could be traced to the poor maternal diet which was correlated with density. Christian’s especially interesting research (1961; 1963;
Christian and Davis, 1964) on endocrine feedback mechanisms provides a physiological rationale for density effects. Density among mice, for example, tends to induce increased pituitary-adrenal
responses, explaining hyperactivity and mortality, and to induce decreased pituitary-gonadal responses, explaining decreased fertility. Research on density effects in non-human populations has also

influenced by the interaction of intra-psychic forces. The third approach, social learning, emphasizes the external conditions which lead to learning of altruistic behavior. This approach considers
the use of reinforcement and modeling as principal mechanisms for perpetuating altruistic behavior. Finally, the cognitive developmental approach postulates that altruistic development is a function
of the level of cognition; social perspective, and moral development attained by the individual. The four approaches are compared in terms of three general issues: the origin of altruism, the
conception of altruism as a state or as a trait, and individual differences in altruism. Analysis of the approaches suggests that each of them refers to a different unit of analysis and that,

and relatively constant (though redistributing) fat mass. Osteoporosis is a major problem of aging in females, as is tooth loss in both sexes. The study of variation in rates of aging is only
beginning, and a number of approaches to measuring biological age in adulthood are presented. Determining the associations of lifestyle, economic, and nutritional status with biological age may reveal
sources of variation in rates of aging and may be of practical importance.","Borkan, Gary A. and Hults, David E. and Mayer, Peter J."

behavior. This article constitutes a critical review of a set of these models developed over the past 15 years. In assessing models of explanation we have only two major concerns, the adequacy of the
logic of the model and the validity of the assumptions when applied to particular field situations. This review is concerned with the first of these, the adequacy of the logic. The review is
structured in terms of some of the standard categories in sociobiology: inclusive fitness, kin selection and altruism; family selection, structured demes, and reciprocal altruism; and finally, group
selection. In reviewing this material it was found that there are major ambiguities in the use of basic terms, most importantly the term fitness. Unfortunately, popu­ lation geneticists have long used
fitness in two senses, one being the average rate of increase of a genotype over a given time period, the other being the relative reproductive contribution of a genotype to the succeeding genera­
tion. The latter concept is more precisely designated selective value (follow­ ing Sewall Wright) . Since popUlation genetics was not a large field in the past, its practitioners seem never to have
had problems with using ""fitness"" to designate either of these concepts. But this review finds that yet a third fitness-like concept has been introduced in the literature of sociobiology. This is
occasionally labeled reproductive success. The utility of this concept is somewhat questionable, as will be shown. The concept of reproductive success may be related to some ambiguities because of the
presence of two kinds of models which infl uence the views","Williams, B J"

522,bernstein_dominance_1981,Dominance: {The} baby and the bathwater,1981-01-01,"Abstract The concept of dominance is used in the behavioral and biological sciences to describe outcomes in a variety of competitive interactions. In some taxa, a history of agonistic encounters among
individuals modifies the course of future agonistic encounters such that the existence of a certain type of relationship can be inferred. If one is to characterize such relationships as dominance,
however, then they must be distinguished from other kinds of interaction patterns for which the term tends to be used, as well as from factors such as territoriality and ""trained"" winners and losers,
which may also influence the expression of agonistic behavior. Operational definitions based on causal, functional, evolutionary, and ontogenetic considerations have been proposed. Reliability and
validity problems have been discussed, but the dominance concept has proved useful despite methodological difficulties. The confusion of dominance relationships (which involve two or more individuals)
with dominance ranks (which are assigned to a single individual) has obscured the possible evolutionary basis of dominance relationships. If benefits accrue to dominant members of pairs, then those
attributes which allow an animal to establish dominance can be selected. Dominance per se and dominance ranks, on the other hand, cannot be genetically transmitted since they constitute relationships
with other individuals rather than absolute attributes. Dominance rankings in particular may be useful for describing behavioral patterns within a group, but they may reflect our own ability to count
rather than any important variable in social organization.","Bernstein, Irwin S."

233,wilson_evolution_1981,{EVOLUTION} {OF} {SEX} {RATIO} {IN} {STRUCTURED} {DEMES},1981-01-01,"In 1930 R. A. Fisher proposed an evolutionary model to explain why so many species produce roughly equal numbers of male and female offspring at birth. Very simply, since each offspring has a male and
female parent (or grandparent, for haplodiploids), whichever sex is in short supply has the greater fecundity. A genotype that produces an excess of the minority sex among its own offspring is favored
by natural selection, until an equilibrium is reached at a 1:1 population sex ratio (assuming male and female offspring cost the same to produce). Charnov (1979) and Maynard Smith (1978) have recently
reviewed the subject. As with many other traits for which fitness is frequency dependent, the evolution of sex ratio is influenced by the spatial structure of the population. To see this, consider an
organism that depends upon some patchy resource. The patches themselves are temporary, but last long enough for the organism to complete one or more generations before dispersal to new patches becomes
necessary. Many small arthropods, parasites, and successional species fit this pattern well, and vertebrates that undergo extreme periodic fluctuations in density approximate it. Now suppose that the
genotype of each female determines the sex ratio of her progeny: one allele codes for a female-biased sex ratio, and another for equal numbers of sons and daughters, with total fecundity the same for
both alleles. If mating is random within each patch, the local frequency of the biased sex ratio allele will decline in every generation in every patch. This is simply a case of Fisher's principle,
which operates with equal force regardless of the size of the breeding group (Colwell, 1981). However, patches will vary by chance in the frequency of the two alleles among the initial colonists.
Defining the occupants of a single patch as a ""group,"" those groups that have a higher initial frequency of the female-biasing allele will produce more grandprogeny, simply because a greater number of
the founders' progeny are females. If the local groups continue to grow in size, the effect will persist through successive generations of local mating, so that a group initiated with a higher than
average frequency of the biased sex ratio allele eventually produces a higher than average number of dispersers. Moreover, the dispersers from such a patch still carry a higher than average frequency
of the allele, in spite of its local decline within every group during each generation of local mating. Consequently, the frequency of the biased sex ratio allele can nonetheless increase in the
global population, to the degree that the differential productivity of groups (group selection) counters the effect of Fisher's principle (individual selection). This process is shown diagrammatically
in Figure 1. It is an example of the structured deme model of population genetics (Uyenoyama and Feldman, 1980; Wilson, 1980), in which the dispersal pool represents the deme as a whole, and the
breeding group in each resource patch is a ""trait group."" In general, the structured deme model explains the evolution of altruism by the differential productivity of trait groups. In the present
case, any female","Wilson, David Sloan and Colwell, Robert K."

Kin
selection is believed to have exerted a significant influence on the evolution of social behaviors (Hamilton, 1964a, 1964b; WestEberhard, 1975; E. 0. Wilson, 1975; Grant, 1978). Maynard Smith (1964)
defined kin selection in contrast to and as an alternative for group selection (Williams, 1966; Lewontin, 1970; Wade, 1977, 1978a). The key distinction between these two evolutionary processes was the
presence or absence of discontinuities in the population breeding structure. Kin selection did ""not require any discontinuities in population breeding structure"" while discontinuities in population
breeding structure were ""an essential condition for group selection."" This distinction was made in response to the suggestions of Wynne-Edwards (1962) that group selection was responsible for the
evolution of a variety of social behaviors including territoriality and dominance hierarchies. It was later suggested (Maynard Smith, 1976) that group selection be restricted to those cases in which
the group was the unit of selection; that is, to those cases in which gene frequency changes occurred by the differential extinction and proliferation of populations. However, the similarities between
kin and group selection are pronounced. Kin selection, like group selection, depends upon the population being structured into groups of related individuals, whether these kin groups exist as actual
physical entities or as a result of the facultative expression of social behaviors. For this reason, several authors have classified kin selection as group selection (D. S. Wilson, 1975, 1979) or as a
form of group selection intermediate between individual and interpopulational selection (Lewontin, 1970; E. 0. Wilson, 1975; Wade, 1978a, 1979; see Grant, 1978, for a review). However, this suggestion
has been strongly opposed (Maynard Smith, 1976), and Dawkins (1979) listed the idea that ""kin selection is a form of group selection"" as one of the ''common errors"" of misunderstanding in discussions
of sociobiology. In experimental studies of kin selection, using laboratory populations of the flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, Wade (1980a) investigated the effects of discontinuities in population
breeding structure on the predictions of kin selection theory. The experiment consisted of synthesizing a strain of T. confusum with genetic variability for the tendency of larvae to cannibalize eggs.
Beetles randomly chosen from this strain were then placed in six different treatments, each representing a different population structure, and the evolution of the cannibalism behavior was followed
for several generations. No artificial selection for or against cannibalism was imposed in these studies; the larval behavior by itself generated selective pressures and the different population
structures determined how the selective forces were distributed. The population structure was varied by varying both the degree of genetic relatedness between the larval cannibals and their egg
victims and the degree of random mating. Depending on the treatment, the genetic relationship between the larvae and eggs was .50 (full-sibs), .25 (half-sibs), or .00 (no relationship). These
""interaction treatments"" were factorially combined with two different breeding structures,","Wade, Michael J. and Breden, Felix"

gametes were resorbed. The drastic effects of these spawning failures were apparent in the population structure in 1980, when the 1978 and 1979 year-classes were shown to be virtually absent, by the
size of the individuals in the population and the numbers of growth lines in their jaws. The population structure in 1975, by contrast, indicated that recruitment during the preceding 4 to 5 yr had
been good. Spawning was also effective in 1980, and an 0 group was detected in August 1980. Comparable data has been obtained for N. caeca, which occurs in the same beach. It shows that recruitment of
this species during 1976–1980 was consistently good, whereas analysis of the age-class frequencies suggests that recruitment of N. caeca was poor in 1973 and 1975. The dominance relationship of the
two species in the beach has been reversed during the period 1975–1980. It is suggested that the sympatric distribution of the two species is maintained in part by periodic reproductive failure. The
causes of this are not yet known; possible reasons, including the extremely cold conditions experienced in 1978–1979 are discussed. The difference in frequency of the 1978, 1979 and 1980 year classes

135,sober_principle_1981,The {Principle} of {Parsimony},1981-01-01,"The principle of parsimony has typically been described and defended as if it were a deletion rule, counseling agnosticism. Ockham, followed by those after him who liked the razor to which he gave his
name, says that a hypothesis should not be asserted, or an entity postulated, if it is not needed to explain anything (Boehner [1957]). The razor slices away; it tells us to remove what is
unnecessary. Modern justifications of parsimoniousness have presupposed this formulation of the principle, and have sought to justify it on grounds of probability. Both Russell ([1951], pp. 148, 155;
[1959], pp. 71, 265, 267-9) and Quine [1966] recognise that removing an existential claim from a theoretical system has the effect of raising the probability of what remains. This is simply because a
conjunction must have a lower probability than either conjunct, provided that the conjuncts are mutually independent. This agnostic version of the razor, although it is neat in both its simple
formulation and its limpid rationale, is mistaken. If we base our characterisation of the razor on what scientists actually achieve when they take it in hand, we must grant that the razor is not
purely negative in its effects. One of the advantages which special relativity is supposed to have over Lorentz's theory is its parsimoniousness with respect to the aether. But this parsimoniousness
does not consist in the fact that special relativity is silent on the question of the aether's existence; rather, the theory implies that there is no such thing (Einstein [1952], Schaffner [1970]). A
recent controversy in evolutionary theory exemplifies the same pattern of thinking. We would have a reason to think that group selection does not exist, if every adaptation could be accounted for by
way of individual selection alone (Williams [1966], Lewontin [1970]). And similarly, for Helmholtz's advocacy of empirism in the theory of visual perception: one reason for thinking that the mind is
endowed with relatively few innate structures is that the minimal postulates of empirism suffice to explain (Helmholtz [1963], Hatfield [1979]). In these cases, and elsewhere in science, the
dispensability of an existence claim is grounds for its denial. The principle of parsimony counsels that toe should hypothesise that an entity does not exist, if its postulation is to no explanatory
point. Agnostic formulations of the methodological maxim belie the way in which the razor is employed to","Sober, Elliott"

A. J. Taylor 1981) defined. (2) A computer simulation model was
devised to investigate the fates of populations in which the movement of individuals is governed by the A-model. The resulting spatial distributions were analysed for conformity with L. R. Taylor's
(1961) Power Law. (3) In a homogeneous environment occupied by an immortal population which reproduced by binary fission, the population spread out in nearly uniform annuli and maintained a near
constant mean density just above the optimum defined in the A-model (p0), as the total number (Nt) increased exponentially. Non-selective mortality reduced the rate of increase of Nt, and may result
in variations in the diameter of the population. (4) Relaxing the assumption of homogeneity of environment broke up the regular annular pattern and reduced the rate of increase of Nt. Expansion of the
population diameter was then no longer uniform; the centre of population moved as new benign areas were discovered and colonized. (5) Change in the environmental matrix introduced non-selective
mortality. Mortality introduced the risk of population extinction when the environment was exceptionally hostile and the degree of mobility low. Highly mobile individuals could survive even in an
environment changing rapidly and drastically. (6) Dividing the simulation arena into regions analogous to demes resulted in a change of scale without qualitative changes in the populations' behaviour.
(7) Reproductive behaviour was made more complex by simulating parthenogenesis and hermaphroditism with the result that the total population number fluctuated widely with high reproductive rate. The
density varied less and return time to the endemic population number after an epidemic was greater than predicted by the logistic equation. Build-ups could also be slower. (8) Comparison of direct and
delayed density-dependent spatial behaviour showed that movement in response to parental density (or migration programmed by parents) results in more rapid buildup and higher peaks of population. (9)
All simulations, whether analysed at an instant or continuously, eventually produced population distributions which conformed to Taylor's Power Law. The behaviour of the rate of aggregation parameter,
b, and its standard error are consistent with the hypothesis that a species' population density surface has a 'preferred' modulation to which it returns after disturbance.","Taylor, R. A. J."

Enclosure experiments run on groups
of spiders subjected to different feeding histories and representing two different populations demonstrate that territory size is a fixed characteristic of specific populations which is not influenced
by temporal changes in prey abundance or in the numbers of competitors present. Data are presented which further show that territory size is adjusted over evolutionary time to lows in prey
availability (times of greatest stringency). The inflexible nature of territorial behavior resulted in the saturation of one habitat offering a limited number of adequate web sites. Removal
experiments showed that approximately 35\% of the population occupying this habitat in 1978 existed as floaters. Floaters suffered marked daily losses in fitness relative to the gains exhibited by
territory holders (measured as changes in body wt). It is concluded that where population growth has not been checked by external factors (e.g., flooding, drought), the poorer competitors fail to
obtain territories and as a consequence die. Surplus individuals are thus eliminated and population numbers will not increase beyond a fixed upper limit, set by the number of available territories.
The system described for one spider species is extended to others and its consequences to their patterns of speciation, community structure, and predatory role are discussed.","Riechert, Susan E."

Wilson published in 1975, he presented sociobiology as a comprehensive theory of evolutionary biology which would eventually “tannibalize” ethology and
comparative psychology, and dominate biology above the molecular level. This “New Synthesis” was achieved by putting together several concepts from earlier streams of thought. One of these was the
notion of a genetically determined society as exemplified by the social insects. This subject had been Wilson’s specialty and, to some extent, sociobiology resulted from extending entomological
sociology to embrace the vertebrates. A second thread woven into the new fabric was the idea of kin selection. From the time of Darwin’s Origin there had been considerable puzzlement over how to
explain the development of self-sacrifice by natural selection. For social organization to function, the individual must sometimes curb his own drives in deference to others, on occasion even to the
point of giving his life. How can giving one’s life increase the probability of leaving descendants? Darwin recognized this dilemma in the case of the social insects (1859, pp. 237-8) and decided it
could be explained by selection favoring members of the family. The sterile worker bee, by devoting her life to the efficient functioning of the hive, would raise the probability that non-sterile
sister queens, with heredity very close to hers, would found other hives. In post-Darwinian times this problem was generally glossed over by picturing selection as favoring “the good of the species.”
In general, this was the position of the ethologists-the students of animal behavic r typified by Lorenz-but they accepted a third idea also accepted by Wilson: that animal behavior, because it had
been formed by natural selection, was adaptive and therefore, genetiplly based. Species-specific behavior was the result of innate releasing mechanisms. In 1962 V. C. Wynne-Edwards in his Animal
Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior carried the “good of the species” idea so far that a strong reaction arose against it. He argued that individual animals reacted to increasing population
density by decreasing their reproductive activity and thus were able to maintain a balance between population and resources. His detractors-for example, G. C. Williams in Adaptation and Natural
Selection (1966)-made clear that for selection to change heredity within the species, it must act between competing individuals and not between deferential groups. Thus the old question of how to
account for the selection of hereditary altruism came up again. In 1955 J. B. S. Haldane had considered this problem in a somewhat relaxed mood.","King, James C."

logic of the model and the validity of the assumptions when applied to particular field situations. This review is concerned with the first of these, the adequacy of the logic. The review is
structured in terms of some of the standard categories in sociobiology: inclusive fitness, kin selection and altruism; family selection, structured demes, and reciprocal altruism; and finally, group
selection. In reviewing this material it was found that there are major ambiguities in the use of basic terms, most importantly the term fitness. Unfortunately, population geneticists have long used
fitness in two senses, one being the average rate of increase of a genotype over a given time period, the other being the relative reproductive contribution of a genotype to the succeeding generation.
The latter concept is more precisely designated selective value (following Sewall Wright). Since population genetics was not a large field in the past, its practitioners seem never to have had
problems with using ""fitness"" to designate either of these concepts. But this review finds that yet a third fitness-like concept has been introduced in the literature of sociobiology. This is
occasionally labeled reproductive success. The utility of this concept is somewhat questionable, as will be shown. The concept of reproductive success may be related to some ambiguities because of the

appropriating the infant - and subsequent (ab-)use - the leader male manages to regain his social position and reinforce his high status. The infant is thus instrumental in the regulation of group-
dynamics - its death almost an accident. The currently common sociobiological approach to the killing of infants in animal societies is to consider it as an adaptive trait. Such a conclusion is
justified only if it can be shown that the behaviour is programmed in such a manner as to contribute systematically to the inclusive fitness of the performer. Such an effect was clearly absent in the
present case. The nature of the proximate mechanism revealed by our study suggests that it is more plausible to consider infant killing as a possible - and occasional - outcome of a behaviour the
proximate goal of which is to achieve social control and dominance. A review of the literature suggests that this approach may fit all cases of infant killing in primate societies, including infant-
abuse in human societies.","Rijksen, Herman D."

exerted an influence over the growth rate and significant reductions  occurred when the floor area was less than (1-2 x total length of lobster)2.  Darkness and low intensity constant illumination
were the most favourable  lighting conditions but shelter provision enhanced the growth rate under a  light-dark regime. Food utilisation was improved by periodic starvation, and  although feeding
every three days was not sufficient to sustain a high growth  rate, daily feeding conferred no advanatage over feeding every two days.  Temperature, salinity and ration level exerted the most direct
effect on the  frequency of moulting, while the other factors had a greater influence on the  size -of the moult increment. The locomotor and feeding activity was studied  under a variety of light
regimes and the effect of shelter, moult stage and  food availability recorded. A weak endogenous nocturnal pattern of locomotor  activity was found under constant conditions but under other light
regimes  activity was irregular and little affected by shelter availability. Daily fed  animals displayed a more pronounced nocturnal activity pattern associated  with feeding activity which was
generally confined to darkness with an overt  rhythmic component. The daily pattern of both locomotor and feeding activity  varied through the moult cycle and considerable variation in response at the

ecological questions within a single conceptual framework. Consequently, the division may break down some of the barriers between studies of primate social ecology conducted in very different

Ethnographic data reviewed here, however, suggest otherwise. In Oceania kinship is an important factor in the selection and treatment of adopted children as adoption occurs almost exclusively among
close relatives. Natal children often ally against their adopted siblings over the division of their common parents' estate while adoptive parents themselves frequently apportion their land unequally
among their natal and adopted children. These patterns and other data are consistent with predictions generated by a socio biological model of adoptive decisions. The model illustrates how kinship
facilitates adoption as a means of modifying extreme family sizes, and how asymmetries in the degrees of relatedness between parents and their adopted and natal children provide the basis of
differential treatment of them. Adoption in Oceania provides an example of a clearly cultural behavior which is consistent with socio biological predictions, and suggests that both culture and biology
are relevant to an understanding of human behavior. [sociobiology, kinship, adoption, Oceania]","Silk, Joan B."

risk. The dispersal of individuals can have profound effects on the genetic structure and demographic processes of a population. The movement of individuals between populations facilitates gene flow
and the maintenance of genetic variability (56, 76). Since dispersal promotes the utilization of new or depopulated areas, it can facilitate the persistence of local popula­ tions and therefore the

There are several sources of this
variation, which can be hereditary as well as non-hereditary, the latter being due to individual age, stochastic events occurring during the life of individual, or social structure within the
population. A general model of population growth and regulation of a differentiated population in discrete time units is given and analytical solutions for two extreme cases are presented. Stability
is impossible in a population with equal resource partitioning among individuals, while unequal resource partitioning allows very stable populations. A further consequence of unequal resource
partitioning and heterogeneous environment is the regulation of population density by emigration, which brings about lower population density, higher food density and even higher stability than
without emigration. A simple model of the evolution of reproductive rates in heterogeneous environment shows that the reproductive rates are linearly proportional to random mortality in local
habitats. The occurrence of regulation of population density by emigration implies a new approach to the relation between ecosystem stability and species diversity.","Łomnicki, Adam and Lomnicki, Adam"

Oporinia autumnata. Birch strains from the outbreak area of the moth had basically similar but less intense immediate defensive responses when compared with birches from outside the outbreak area.
After defoliation, however, birches from the outbreak area had strong intensification of defence mechanisms lasting at least three years while a birch strain originating from outside the outbreak area
did not have any such response. Hence, birch defences offer a causal explanation why the moth population will probably not start a new increase immediately after the previous one in the outbreak area.
Several density-induced responses of the moth could be explained as adaptations when the defensive tactics of the host tree were known. For example, aggregated larvae grew better than solitary ones on
poor birch leaves with strong induced defence (probable diet at high larval densities) while solitary larvae grew better than crowded ones on high quality birch leaves (probable at low densities).
Assumptions underlying the plant defence theory on herbivore fluctuations are discussed. The true importance of plant defences is easily masked by increased susceptibility to predation, parasitism,
etc. Hence experiments are needed to reveal causal relations. Some experiments able to falsify the theory are proposed, as well as suggestions for avoiding obvious errors in the design of experiments.
The evolutionary basis of herbivore fluctuation, as well as the evolution of resource-saving adaptations, is discussed.","Haukioja, Erkki"

To some it
has also seemed self-evident that the signaler thereby decreased its chances of survival (Brereton 1959; Maynard Smith 1965; Hirth and McCullogh 1977). It has been the evolutionary implications of
that second assumption that have been responsible for most of the interest in this topic. If it could be demonstrated that such behavior was not only altruistic but that it operated among social
groups that were not kin groups it would provide evidence for ""group selection,"" the Achilles' heel of the theory of population self-regulation (Wynne-Edwards 1962). Opponents of these ideas can
invoke the rule of parsimony and argue that this kind of behavior is not altruistic but self-serving (Smythe 1970; Charnov and Krebs 1975). However, we do not believe that these authors have been as
parsimonious as they might have been. Our observations on the ""alarm"" signal of the eastern swamphen (Porphyrio prophyrio L.) indicate to us that this signal is intended for the predator, not
conspecifics. Our thesis is related to that of Smythe (1970), who proposed that the display of the white rump patch in various herbivorous mammals ""invited pursuit"" from a predator. Our interpretation
f how a predator is likely to respond to an alarm signal is, however, different. We provide evidence that alarm signals act as ""pursuit deterrent"" signals.","Woodland, D. J. and Jaafar, Zarinah and Knight, Mary-Lou"

breeding density, except ephemerally in 1 year. Nor did the removal of these birds affect populations in the surrounding area. These data confirm results from earlier studies with blue grouse, that
surplus yearlings of both sexes are present on the breeding range. Replacement yearlings of both sexes (those taking the place of birds removed) were able to breed, but those removed sequentially
(1974 to 1976) were lighter in body weight than those captured on control areas or those that settled synchronously after a near-total removal experiment in the same area. I infer from these results

has a physical advantage over its sibling. The larger chick often kills the small chick, or forces it from the nest. Such chick mortalities are believed to be the major source of reproductive loss for
the species ( 1, 2, 3 ). Asynchronous hatching of eggs has been proposed as a mechanism enabling many avian species to adjust brood size to interseasonal variations in unpredictable food supplies (4,
5, 6). Parent birds feed larger nestlings before smaller chicks and in seasons of scarce food the smaller chick dies without nutritional cost to its sibling. This theory may apply to the asynchronous
hatch of white pelicans, but the hatching intervals of eggs in a clutch has neither been quantified nor interpreted relative to chick survival.","Knopf, F."

Individual and kin selection, on the one hand, and group selection, on the other, are viewed as alternative scientific paradigms for interpreting aggression and other behaviors. It is suggested that
the crux of the conflict between these positions involves different ways of explaining altruism. Often, restraints in fighting are tacitly assumed to function first and foremost for the good of the
group or species to the detriment of the actor – ie, to be altruistic and to have evolved by group selection. The frequent use of the group level “good for the species” explanations in various
disciplines is noted.     A second and overlapping objective of this paper is to present evidence against group selection level interpretations and to propose instead that individual level selection
and inclusive fitness theory explain better and provide a heuristically more useful way of examining aggressive behavior. Toward these ends, ritualized aggressive behaviors, formerly assumed to exist
for species preservation, are reinterpreted along individualistic lines. Next, the concept of inclusive fitness [Hamilton, 1964] is discussed as a theoretical breakthrough which adds support to an
individual level approach. In short, the argument is set forth that animals, by and large, do not kill or seriously injure members of their own species because it usually is not in their genetic self-
interest to do so; social patterns of interaction such as aggressive encounters should be examined in terms of their effects on the fitness of the individuals engaging in the behaviors before group
adaptations are simply assumed. In illustration, data from several animal behavior studies are discussed. Consideration is also given to instances of intraspecific killing and wounding, which in fact
occur much more frequently than has been suggested by members of a group selectionist school of thought. Infant killing reported in lions and various primate species is examined and shown to be
explicable through individual selection and inclusive fitness theory. It is concluded that this approach represents a more viable theoretical framework for the evolutionary and functional study of
both ritualized and other forms of limited animal aggression as well as more violent incidents of intraspecific wounding and killing.","Fry, Douglas P."

critical minimum space that must be maintained if the organism is to persist. Although resources within this space may be diverted into reproduction and the rearing of young, the continued occupancy
of the parent's resource space by the offspring, or vice versa, is a threat to survival. Yet the movement of either parent or offspring away from the natal site is likely to place the disperser at
risk. The dispersal of individuals can have profound effects on the genetic structure and demographic processes of a population. The movement of individuals between populations facilitates gene flow
and the maintenance of genetic variability (56, 76). Since dispersal promotes the utilization of new or depopulated areas, it can facilitate the persistence of local populations and therefore the
stability of the species over large geographic areas (136, 139). In spite of this, ecologists until recently have largely neglected dispersal as a demographic parameter that affects population
density. This may be because we cannot distinguish between natality and immigration or","Gaines, M. and Mcclenaghan, L."

the larger colonies not only start laying earlier, but the time taken by the whole colonies to lay their crop of eggs is shorter than in the colonies of lesser numbers” (Darling, 1938, p. 67). Darling
stated “... the most obvious interpretation is to be found in the total value of visual auditory stimulation for each pair in the larger flocks, compared with the total amount of such stimulation in
the smaller flocks.” He concluded that breeding synchrony, realized by social stimulation, may be density related (Darling, 1938, p. 55).","Ryder, John P."

Interspecific competition may result in competitive exclusion of one
or several species, or it may lead to a change in the microhabitat of one or all co-occurring species (interactive site segregation), but there is no evidence that such effects lead to evolutionary
changes and avoidance of competition, i.e., to selective site segregation. That extrinsic factors, particularly competition, are not of such great evolutionary significance among parasites as is
usually assumed, is indicated by the following observations. Most effects of competitive exclusion may also be caused by intraspecific crowding. Interspecific effects may also be positive, enhancing
the chances of species co-occurring. Host-mediated effects are usually more harmful to the species evoking them than to competing species. Parasite species with coinciding or overlapping microhabitats
often show no interactions. Related species commonly have widely overlapping niches. Only a small proportion of the niches available to ectoparasites of fish is filled. Species with mouthparts of
different sizes may use the same food in the same habitat, i.e., such differences do not necessarily indicate segregation. Evidence for the effect of species intrinsic factors is that in many cases
microhabitats are extremely restricted, even though competing species do not exist and cannot have existed in the past, for instance in fish species at high latitudes with only one species of
ectoparasite. Circumstantial evidence shows that an important factor responsible for niche restriction in parasites is selection to increase intraspecific contact and thus mating. Niche
diversification is self-augmenting, and in a continuously expanding niche space populations would be diluted to such a degree that mating would become impossible without the counteracting selection
for niche restriction. The probability that two species show complete niche coincidence is infinitesimally small even without competition, and it is therefore not permissible to use niche differences
as proof for competition.","Rohde, Klaus"

55,hoffman_community_1979,Community paleoecology as an epiphenomenal science,1979-01-01,"The most important topics discussed thus far by community paleoecologists are: community approach to paleoenvironmental reconstruction, community development in evolutionary time, and community
constraints upon species evolution. The first step in community-paleoecological analysis is to reconstruct the paleocommunity or paleoecosystem. However there are severe methodological limitations to
any inference drawn from the composition and structure of a fossil assemblage. These result from various taphonomic biases. These constraints upon reliability of a community-paleoecological analysis
are the least severe in the case of Cenozoic (and possibly Cretaceous) tropical to subtropical, molluskdominated, subtidal, benthic communities. The basic assumption of community paleoecology is that
communities or biocoenoses represent a distinct, real level of biotic organization achieved through ecological integration of and coevolution among the species. This assumption seems to be invalid for
two reasons. (1) The actual degree of community integration is in general insufficient to induce any driving forces for a structural development as predicted by the system theory. (2) The concept of
biological reality and distinctness of the community level of biotic organization implies assignment of a significant role to group selection. The assumption that ecological communities achieve with
time an equilibrium state representing an optimum habitat partitioning among the component species is invalid, at least as a generalization. This idea is largely falsified and refuted by a variety of
ecological studies. Ecological communities are then merely an epiphenomenon of the overlap in distributional patterns of various organisms. There is no intrinsic, biotic mechanism inducing community
dynamics in either ecological, or evolutionary time. In spite of this conclusion, the so-called “community approach” under favorable taphonomic conditions is among the most reliable methods of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and the data on so-called “community evolution” are relevant to the problem of a relationship between actually realized niche patterns and their environmental
framework. The latter problem can also be approached through analysis of longevity-frequency-distributions of chronospecies found living together in various habitats. A preliminary investigation may
indicate that the precondition to optimization of niche dimensions through coevolution among ecologically related species was met in subtidal benthic habitats but not in pelagic ones. To account for a
niche subdivision among planktonic organisms, one has therefore to invoke a stochastic pattern of speciation rather than coevolutionary mechanisms.","Hoffman, Antoni"
123,erben_paleobiological_1979,Paleobiological and isotopic studies of eggshells from a declining dinosaur species,1979-01-01,"Late Cretaceous dinosaur eggshells from southern France and the Spanish Pyrenees, presumably belonging to the sauropod Hypselosaurus priscus Matheron, are almost exclusively composed of primary
calcite. Besides normal development of these eggshells, there appear two kinds of pathologic tendencies: bi- or multi-shells (infrequent), and shells with a reduced thickness (increasing in frequency
until, in the uppermost horizon, they represent more than 90\% of the sample). The extinction of the species is attributed primarily to the consequences of thinning of the eggshells.   The
physiological mechanisms producing pathologic dinosaur eggshells are evaluated in the light of homologous phenomena occurring in living birds and reptiles. On this basis, it is concluded that in the
late Maastrichtian populations of “Hypselosaurus,” pathologic eggshells were caused by hormonal imbalances of the vasotocin and of the estrogen levels. On the same basis it is postulated that the
teratological shell repetition led to embryo suffocation and that the pathological reduction in shell thickness caused shell breakage and dehydration of the embryo. The lethal results are evident from
the frequent absence of “resorption craters” in the mammillary knobs of pathologic shells, a fact which indicates either lack of fertilization of the eggs or the perishing of the embryo prior to the
calcification of its skeletal bones. A change in environmental conditions is the ultimate factor which caused hormonal imbalances and extinction. Such a change is indicated by a shift of the mean
oxygen isotopic composition (δ 18 O) of eggshell carbonates from −0.6\% o to −5.3\% o , and by changes in Sr. Information of palaeo-climate is primarily derived from eggshells of living birds and
reptiles. The correlation between temperature and oxygen isotopic composition of waters (and related carbonates) is less distinct than for marine carbonates. δ 13 C ranges from −16.5 to −4.5 of
eggshells of extant species indicate food from “normal” C 3 metabolism and from C 4 metabolism of plants in a dry climate. “Hypselosaurus” populations probably consumed “normal” C 3 plants. Using
isotopic calibration of eggshell carbonates for the interpretation of δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of dinosaur eggshells, a slight change from higher to lower temperatures or a change from a dry to a more
humid climate during the time from Lower (and Middle) to Late Maastrichtian can be assumed. The latter explanation is favored because the exceptionally high Sr in the Early Maastrichtian eggshells
could be a potential indicator of co-existing evaporites.","Erben, H. K. and Hoefs, J. and Wedepohl, K. H."

The
model includes all attenuation mechanisms and is used to illuminate possible reasons for the dawn chorus obseved in birds and primates under a diverse array of environmental conditions. Also explored
are the possible effects of calling height and calling frequency on broadcast coverage. Solely from the point of view of atmospheric attenuation mechanisms, early morning microclimatic conditions are
as optimal for sound propagation as will be present at any other time during the day or night. Depending on the environment, calls voiced at such times are up to 20 times more effective in area of
broadcast coverage than the same amplitude signal broadcast at midday. Such an advantage goes far in explaining why many animal species have selected these times for territorial and/or mate attracting
communicatory announcements. Increasing height above the substrate also increases the area of broadcast coverage under many environmental conditions, since greater elevation reduces the effects of
steep near-surface temperatures and wind velocity gradients in refraction of the sound waves. This mechanism leads to the formation of shadow zones whereby signals can become inaudible at short
distances from the source. Decreasing signal frequency also increases area of coverage and thereby leads to a seeming paradox, since in open environments where wind and turbulence effects predominate
animals tend to have higher pitched calls. A hypothesis is advanced based on communication theory and sound transmission through a turbulent medium whereby information transfer may be enhanced by the
use of higher frequencies.","Henwood, Kenneth and Fabrick, Allan"

Historians are professionally concerned with change, and therefore with the absence of change (which is one of the ways of defining continuity). If volumes I-XII of the New Cambridge Modern History
have already dealt with these themes, the reader may well be asking what is the point of a thirteenth volume, which covers the same period as all the rest, from the late fifteenth to the mid-twentieth
century. The short answer to this question is that there is more than one way of being concerned with change, or more than one kind of change to be concerned with. Historians have traditionally dealt
with the narrative of events, especially political events; Thucydides, Tacitus, Guicciardini, Clarendon and Ranke are among the great masters of this genre in the West. This style of history involves
a close study of changes over the short-term. The traditional historian may also be interested in changes over the long-term; he may choose his subject because he thinks it a ‘turning-point’ in
history; but he is likely to assume rather than to argue that a break in continuity occurred at this point. Guicciardini began his History of Italy and Ranke began his Latin and Teutonic Nations with
the turning-point of the 1490s, just like the old and the New Cambridge Modern History , but they did not justify their choice in any detail.","Burke, Peter"

should vary when environmental conditions change. With an idealized portrayal of the effects of environmental change introduced to a fitness set analysis of the trade-off between reproduction and
survival, we find that the optimal reproductive effort is indifferent to environmental change. Deviations from this null case are obtained in a more general model, where we find that a pattern of
increasing reproductive effort with environmental amelioration and decreasing reproductive effort with environmental deterioration is predicted when older breeding age classes are less affected by
environmental change that are younger age classes, or when the potential adult survival rates are less affected by environmental change than are the potential survival rates of dependent young or the
potential natality rates. Where the converse of these conditions obtains, the reverse pattern of change of reproductive effort will be favored. The assumptions of the null-case model provide precise
definitions of the threshold conditions at which the pattern of reproductive effort will switch from one type to the other. The circumstances under which regulation of reproductive effort is predicted
to be expressed as an increase in reproductive effort in more favorable times and a decrease in less favorable times are commonly met, especially in the life histories of many long-lived vertebrates.
Thus the analysis of optimal life histories offers a competing explanation for some patterns of reproductive behavior that are otherwise described as social adaptations that evolved in response to the
selective advantage of population regulation.","Goodman, Daniel"

that territory size is regulated to maintain food supply: individual hummingbirds make daily adjustments in their territories. These adjustments maintain food supplies from day lo day and improve them
over what they would be if no adjustments were made. The ability of individuals to maintain territory quality, however, and the length of time they remain in the meadows, is affected by their age and
sex and by the level of competition for food by conspecifics. Territoriality, therefore, must be considered in relation to factors operating beyond the local food environment, both in terms of effects
on and effects of the short-term dynamics of energy regulation. This has important implications for hummingbird migration.","Gass, Clifton Lee"

A hypothesis is advanced that such animals make use of disturbances in climax ecosystems
to survive and to exploit the more food-productive seasons. Then landscape composition will greatly influence the densities of breeding populations in their normal habitats. Evidence is given that
food increases drastically in spring in climax or normal habitats, e.g. from increases in herbage biomass and its nutrient composition, indirectly from regional differences in litter size and from the
unsaturated state of northern bird communities. Secondary successions and human cultivation are shown to bring new or increased food supply in winter. The landscape effect on breeding populations is
related to seasonality, animal movements and distribution, predictability and successional states of disturbances. Landscape effects are traced for a series of Scandinavian homeotherms, ranging from
cervids to migrant birds via some more or less synanthropic species. Recent changes in landscape composition are shown to have profoundly affected their breeding populations. However, in the long run
certain predictable disturbances may be of no use for animals from other habitats due to competition from settled conspecifics. Some animals may have become adapted to exploit disturbances in climax
ecosystems. Such adaptations may be as important as migration or hibernation in other species. Better knowledge of these adaptations or similar general characteristics and of recent changes in
landscape composition may enable us to interpret many changes in abundance which are now obscure.","Hansson, Lennart"

what is the unit of selection? Classically, the differential survival and reproduction of individuals, or individual selection, are regarded as the major cause of genie evolution. More recently, units

contemporary mammalian orders contain mostly small species, and 90 per cent of the 3900 recognized recent species weigh {\textless}5 kg. Small mammals are represented in each of the three major lines
of mammalian evolution (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals), and the diversity of their trophic and ecological adaptations is impressive, ranging from fossorial grazers (e.g. pocket gophers and
mole rats) to aerial carnivores (e.g. several species of phyllostomatid bats). Given such a diverse array of lifestyles, it should not be surprising to learn that small mammals have evolved numerous
life-history strategies in adapting to a wide range of environments. In this chapter, I propose to discuss the basic concepts underlying the evolution of the life-history strategies of small mammals
and will illustrate these concepts with data from the recent mammalian literature. Before outlining what I believe to be the major components of mammalian life-histories and how such life-histories
evolve, I wish to briefly review the advantages and disadvantages of (1) being small and (2) being a small mammal. As we will see, size per se can place major constraints on many aspects of an

users, who occupy fast-flowing areas such as the heads of pools; (2) suboptimal habitat users, who occupy stiller water; and (3) non-users, who form dense lethargic clusters by the margins of the
stream. The distributions are enforced by the dominant animals and lead to a priority of prey capture. Dominance is determined mostly by age, sex, and disability. ECOLOGISTS RECOGNIZE TWO FORMS of
competition (Miller 1967): Exploitation, in which an organism interacts only with its resources, and interference, in which an organism interacts directly with its competitors, excluding them from
resources and thereby obtaining more for itself. The theoretical consequences of exploitation are fairly well worked out, and in fact form the foundation of the Lotka-Volterra equations on which most
competition models are based. However, the theoretical consequences of interference are less well understood, and, moreover, seem to lead to a greater variety of outcomes (Schoener 1976). Many
questions present themselves. Does interference simply space animals out over the available habitat (Huxley 1934) or does it generate a have/have-not situation in which one segment of the population
lives amidst relative plenty while another starves, disperses, or lives in areas that will not support offspring (Brown 1969) ? If the latter, what determines the proportions of the population falling
into these classes and how do they change with fluctuations in food supply? Does interference constitute a form of population regulation (see Rogers and Hassel 1974. Rogers and Hubbard 1974, Wynne-
Edwards 1962, Wilson 1977 for different approaches), and, if so, is regulation the essence of, or coincidental to, its evolution? How are subordinate animals maintained in the population if they are
so severely selected against by interference? This paper describes a very simple field study on interference competition and some of its consequences in a population of the tropical ripple bug
Rhagovelia scabra Bacon (Hemiptera: Veliidae). The data are of interest for two reasons. First, they show how a surprisingly 'vertebrate' form of population structure can exist in an insect using
simple behavior patterns. The ripple bug's population structure closely resembles that which Brown (1969) describes for birds. Second, working with insects allows manipulations that are difficult, if
not impossible, for vertebrates, on which most studies of this type are conducted. The research site was on the Rio Guacimal, a high mountain stream near Monte Verde, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica.

that (a) humans are programmed not only to be egoistic but also, under certain conditions, to help another at cost to themselves; and (b) what was selected was not altruistic action but mediators of
action, because this provided the necessary flexibility. Psychological evidence is then presented that complements this view. Thus (a) there appears to a general human tendency to help others in
distress, which has properties analagous to egoistic motivation and yet comes into play independently of egoistic motivation; and (b) the evolutionary requirements for a mediating mechanism appear to
be met by empathy, e.g., it is reliably aroused in humans in response to misfortune in others, it predisposes the individual toward helping action and yet is amenable to perceptual and cognitive
control, and its physiological basis may have been present in early humans. The social implications of a biological basis for human altruism are discussed.","Hoffman, Martin L."

individuals of the prey population with better chances to escape predation. In such situations it is shown that a certain identity of interests between the predator and some of its potential prey can
evolve. Conditions for formation of an evasive herd can be analyzed as a nonzero-sum prey-predator game. Under a wide variety of conditions it can be shown that the optimum behavior for a fast prey is
always such as to maximize the predation probability of the slowest prey. Finally, some other biological phenomena, typical to either evasive prey or its predators, are also suggested as following

single species populations. This latter phenomenon has not previously been taken into account by theoretical ecologists, although it is of basic importance for regulation of population density. (2)
Unequal resource partitioning increases the stability of a confined population and allows emigration of some population members into suboptimal and hostile areas to evolve by individual selection. (3)
In a local habitat supplied by a constant inflow of food, animal density is lower and food density is higher when emigration occurs, than without emigration. (4) Regulation of population density by
emigration allows for the adjustment of this density to the amount of food, in such a way that mortality is not directly due to food shortage but to other agents (predators, adverse weather
conditions, etc.). (5) Animals with overlapping generations and cyclic changes in population density can emigrate at lower density level, than that determined by food supply at any given point in
time. At high densities such populations can also exhibit reduced reproduction, which under certain circumstances can be considered as an adaptation. (6) Population outbreaks are thought of as a
failure of population regulation by emigration resulting from spatial homogeneity of the environment. Homogeneity diminishes both differences among individuals in local populations and differences
between local habitats and their surroundings, these in turn can make regulation by emigration impossible","Lomnicki, Adam"
84,buck_toward_1978,Toward a {Functional} {Interpretation} of {Synchronous} {Flashing} by {Fireflies},1978-01-01,"In certain firefly species of tropical Southeast Asia the males habitually congregate in trees in huge numbers and flash in rhythmic synchrony all night, each night. Though females do not synchronize,
they are attracted to the trees and mate there. Many fireflies remain in the trees by day. We believe that each display tree approximates a steady-state population in which a constant number of males,
stabilized by a balance of inflying and eventual death, is interacting with a constant flux of females, stabilized by a balance of in- and out-migration. There are some very tenuous indications that
different tree populations may be partially isolated and somewhat inbred. The mass-display fireflies are unique in possessing a neural mechanism that automatically synchronizes the rhythmic flashing
of conspecific males. Mass congregation and mass synchrony are therefore inseparable. All evidence agrees in indicating that the mass synchronized assemblies are exclusively reproductive. In the Thai
Pteroptyx malaccae and the Melanesian Pteroptyx cribellata and Luciola pupilla we believe that courtship and mating involve two successive photic interactions. Distant males and females are being
attracted indiscriminately into the tree by the massed rhythmic luminescence of the in-tree males. The range and species-specificity of this attraction are enhanced by the flash synchronization.
Simultaneously males established individually in the tree and flashing rhythmically in small, defended territories compete for in-tree females. In extension of Lloyd's analysis, we postulate mutual
recognition via one or more sexual differences in light emission and surmise that the female probably does most of the short-range moving connected with pair formation. We postulate that the female
selects her mate on the basis of the intensity of his signal relative to those of other males visible to her simultaneously. As in Lloyd's model the selection must depend on a genetic predilection of
females for males that are flashing synchronously. Poststimulus refractoriness is suggested as the mechanism for the predilection. The synchronized tree congregation thus performs a long-range
attraction of both males and females to the tree and simultaneously operates as a huge permanent lek. In the various in-tree interactions, flash synchronization is thought to improve mating
opportunity for all participants and to exclude possible conspecific cheaters. The orthodox view that large-scale synchrony must be only the incidental or statistical consequence of a small-scale
adaptive synchrony is questioned on the following bases: 1. From natural selection theory, flash synchronization per se, being a group behavior, cannot serve as the competitive agent for promoting the
reproductive fitness of an individual participating male, no matter how small the synchronizing group. 2. Flash synchronization is, for physiological reasons, obligatory between two or more close-
together males. Mass synchrony depends on mass congregation. 3. Because most fireflies court by continuous line-of-sight photic contact, environmental obstacles such as abound in the jungly vegetation
of Southeast Asia could be a major obstacle to dialogue-type communication. Conversely, the formation by males of a large, concentrated communal light beacon, visible through vegetation for long
distances in all directions, might attract more females per unit time than a given male would meet in solo search through a population dispersed in dense vegetation. 4. Such a congregation, it is
argued, would benefit all participating males, penalize none, and be safeguarded against nonflashing or nonsynchronizing cheaters by the female's requirement for flash coincidence during comparison of
male flash intensities. Mass congregation could thus, we suggest, be a group adaptation, made possible by unique physiological and ecological circumstances. The observed evolutionary perpetuation of
the behavior is made possible by the fact that flashing-the act that, when synchronized, permits nonspecific sexual gain at two levels (increased mate accessibility for both sexes and eligibility for
individual competition between males)-can also be modulated to serve as the competitive instrument between conspecific males vying for selection by females. Any synchronizing male in the congregation
who mates will therefore transmit the genetic basis for the flash synchronization as well as that controlling competitive use of flash intensity, and the female will gain by having selected a
competitive mate.","Buck, John and Buck, Elisabeth"

support but inadequately accounts for evidence that SIB can arise in the absence of reinforcement, is often difficult to modify, and has features unlike those of conditioned behavior. Alternative
possibilities are suggested. Neurological damage is common in populations displaying SIB and may produce inadequate pain perception or avoidance. Stereotyped behavior, also common in these
populations, may also be related to SIB. Stress and isolation, both strongly correlated with SIB, may evoke this behavior by altering levels of biogenic amines and affecting the probability of
aggressive responses. Finally, SIB may have been favored in evolution by group and kin selection, as the loss of a damaged individual may actually favor his genotype through promotion of relatives.
These alternatives are not necessarily mutually incompatible nor do they preclude a degree of flexibility in SIB. SIB may result from the interaction of several variables that independently increase
its probability.","deCatanzaro, Denys A."

suggestions [e.g., Neill 1971; Alvarez del Toro 1974; Hunt 1974] that adults other than the parent female protect juvenile crocodilians.) Correlatively, two main functions have been attributed to the
call: (1) a distress call to attract the attention of the parent female, and (2) an alarm call to alert nearby conspecifics in the same pod (groups of young which remain together for varying periods
of time after hatching). Subadults and adults of at least two species, Alligator mississippiensis (McIlhenny 1935) and Caiman crocodiles (personal observation), also give the call, but only rarely. At

conditions in natural populations would fall within the bounds imposed by the models, group selection, by and large, has been considered an insignificant force for evolutionary change. These

In particular, the published estimates lack confidence intervals. (2) A
simulation model is described which estimates daily energy requirements of seabird populations. Biomasses of breeders, non-breeders and chicks present in the vicinity of the colony, are coupled with
an ambient temperature function, the bioenergetic equations of Kendeigh, and calculations of the energy costs of digestion, activity, egg production and growth. (3) The model is tested using input
data sets for great skua Catharacta skua Brinnich and Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea Pontopp. Sensitivity of the model to errors in input parameters, and the output errors resulting from known
imprecisions in the forty-four input parameters are examined. Output precision is largely determined by a few parameters, which depend partly on the life-style energy allocation of the species. (4) A
Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the precision of the estimated energy requirements of the two species' populations. This suggests that, using currently available input data, the population
energy requirement estimate has a 95\% confidence interval of + 50o of the mean. (5) Energy requirements could be considerably more precisely determined if only a small number of input parameters were
more precisely known. These limiting parameters are listed. (6) The model is applied to one particular seabird community, on Foula, Shetland, for which detailed data have been collected. The mean
estimate of the total energy requirement of this community (1 2 x 101 0 kcal yr - 1) represents 29\% of the mean estimate of the total annual fish production within a 45 km radius of the colony. This
implies that seabirds, predatory demersal fish and industrial fisheries are in direct competition for the energy flow from pelagic fish, such that any increase in the energy flow to one of these would
result in a reduced energy availability to the others.","Furness, R. W."

In both sexes, scent gland activity is dependent on gonadal hormones. Observations on colonies of gerbils, living in
enclosures or cages, showed that both scent gland size and marking behaviour were related to social status. In colonies founded by a single pair, breeding was confined to the original female. The
infertility of the daughters was due to failure of sexual maturation. As this was always associated with a lack of development of the scent glands, the functional state of the latter could be used as
an index of fecundity. A change in social organization (eg removal of the parents) caused previously infertile females to conceive and was accompanied by development of the scent glands If there was
competition for dominance, the scent glands of the losers regressed; at autopsy, their ovaries and uteri appeared to be nonfunctional. The founding father usually had a larger scent gland than his
sons, but the inhibition of sexual function was not as severe as in the females. However, the father characteristically showed much more marking behaviow in a neutral territory than his sons. None of
the fem ales-except the mother-showed appreciable marking, and her scores were much lower than those of the dominant male. Asymptotic populations were reached at about the same level in enclosures and
cages, implicating an intrinsic capacity for control independent of the number of animals per unit of space but probably related to the natural size of a social group. Stabilization of numbers was
achieved not only by reproductive inhibition of young females, but also by cessation of breeding by the founding mother and death of litters. Littermates raised in enclosures without their parents
showed delayed sexual maturation accompanied by fighting which resulted in the formation of a hierarchy headed by a breeding female and a dominant (marking) male.","Swanson, Heidi H. and Lockley, M. Ruth"

Comparisons of these were made by developing
stochastic simulations of their movements based on an analysis of the frequency distributions of step lengths, angles of turn and the percentage time spent actively swimming.  The dispersal and escape
of displaced fish from an unfamiliar area of the loch can be explained principally in terms of random turning. Nose plugging appears to influence the distribution of the angles of turn without
significantly altering the time taken to escape and return home. Indigenous trout show a strong preference for turns of 180°, indicating a tendency to turn in their tracks. Although a simulation of
the indigenous fish shows slower dispersion than displaced fish, it is insufficient to explain the containment of movement within a home range. It is probable that successive steps are not independent
and there may be some association between step lengths and subsequent angles of turn. The implications of their autocorrelation are discussed.","Tytler, P. and Machin, D. and Holliday, F. G. T. and Priede, I. G."

clear that there was insufficient evidence to associate scent-marking behaviour, in mammals in general and specifically in the gerbil, with the defence of a territory and that this behaviour could
serve other functions. Experiments were then reported which investigated the Links between the agonistic behaviour, territoriality and scent-marking in the gerbil. An ethogram of its agonistic

comparative work in a moorland gull colony on Mallowdale Fell in the Pennines. A cull of the herring gull population, which had hitherto been increasing at 13\% per annum, has been practised by the
Nature Conservancy Council on the Isle of May yearly since 1972, and special attention was given in this study to the biological effects of culling. The population trends were followed in detail up to
1977, and it was shown that the annual, recruitment rate has been very variable since 1972 and there has been a shortfall in the number of young gulls predicted to join the breeding population. These
have presumably moved and some ringed gulls were located breeding in other colonies. The population has been held at about 20-25\% of its 1972 level since 1975. With many of the older gulls having
been culled, the average age of the population had been reduced, so that by 1977 about 50\% of the population was breeding for the first time. Despite a strong correlation between parental age and
percentage breeding success, the average number of chicks fledged per pair in control areas was 0.82, which was as high as that recorded in a previous study by Parsons (1971, unpublished Ph.D. thesis,
Durham University) on the Isle of May in the late 1960s. In addition, it was found that the median date of laying was the same as that estimated by Parsons, and that egg size (positively correlated
with chick survival) had increased significantly. Experiments on recruitment by manipulating breeding density showed that at the highest densities recorded the annual recruitment rate was close to the
average annual mortality rate. In areas where density had been greatly reduced, the recruitment rate was insufficient to replace annual adult mortality, and in some areas no recruitment was recorded.
There was a broad, optimal breeding density of between 2 and 10 nests/l00m({\textasciicircum}2) where highest recruitment rates took place. Much of the Isle of May was found to be at this density as a
result of culling. Birds which spread their nests most uniformly were the most successful breeders, and the majority of nests were thus spaced. Aggression was found to increase with density. The
rationale of gull culling has been discussed for the Isle of May, together with recommendations for future culls on the island and elsewhere.","Duncan, W. N."
12,reed_darwins_1978,Darwin's evolutionary philosophy: {The} laws of change,1978-01-01,"The philosophical or metaphysical architecture of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is analyzed and diflussed. It is argued that natural selection was for Darwin a paradigmatic case of
a natural law of change — an exemplar of what Ghiselin (1969) has called selective retention laws. These selective retention laws lie at the basis of Darwin's revolutionary world view. In this essay
special attention is paid to the consequences for Darwin's concept of species of his selective retention laws. Although Darwin himself explicity supported a variety of nominalism, implicit in the
theory of natural selection is a solution to the dispute between nominalism and realism. It is argued that, although implicit, this view plays a very important role in Darwin's theory of natural
selection as the means for the origin of species. It is in the context of these selective retention laws and their philosophical implications that Darwin's method is appraised in the light of recent
criticisms, and the conclusion drawn that he successfully treated some philosophical problems by approaching them through natural history. Following this an outline of natural selection theory is
presented in which all these philosophical issues are highlighted.","Reed, Edward S."

perspectives. Our own experience has encompassed studies of the evolutionary bases of human behavior on the one hand and two decades of clinical experience with addicts of various kinds (and their
families) on the other. Departing from the conventional view that addiction arises solely from the life history of an individual or out of an obscure chemical imbalance, we have come to a formulation
of the problem, rather, as one of the effects of group mechanisms upon the individual. The dynamics residing within the entity we call a society affects all its members. There are those who can adapt
themselves to group requirements and others who in some or many ways cannot. This applies to all social groups of all creatures, whether animal or human. Very frequently manifestations that appear to
us to be peculiarly human, when compared with the patterns of life of other animals, come to be thought of as due to our cultural endowment or to our specific civilization and as phenomena that
therefore define a separation between our species and all others. Language, love, politics, and the care of the sick are among many human propensities and predilections that come into this category.
Yet everything human has its origin in an animal past, and such a view tends to prevent certain aspects of human behavior from being seen in a context of overall natural patterns, hindering full
understanding of their significance. The problem of addiction is certainly a human one, and it has not been thought of in terms of comparative behavior. The reason is simple. Addiction does not occur
in a natural state. Laboratory animals may be induced artificially to become addicted to most of the substances on which a human being may become physiologically or psychologically dependent, but this
does not happen in feral conditions. Nor, on the other hand, is the presence of ""mind"" in man an explanation for the","Jonas, Doris F. and Jonas, A. David"

United States laws require that they be managed ‘to maintain the health and stability of the marine

maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and asymptotic levels. Emerging evidence pertaining to marine mammals, and perhaps applicable to a larger class of vertebrates, indicates that the MSY point may be well
above the logistic-curve 50\% point. ‘Reproduction curves’ of various sorts are used in management as operational representations of population self-regulation (density-dependence). A variety of
theories and hypotheses concerning such regulation now exists, though none is adequately supported as yet. A general model for self-regulation in long-lived species is suggested as being comprised of
stages of regulation. Immature mortality is postulated as the first stage, followed by age of first reproduction and then reproductive rates of adult females. The fourth and last stage, as populations
reach maximum sustainable levels, is assumed to involve changes in adult survival. Although a model of the kind suggested here offers some useful insights as to harversting strategies, a more

effect is to increase the relative contribution to future gene pools of individuals capable of defending territories in optimum habitat. Alternative hypotheses are compared, and ways are suggested to
distinguish among them. Available empirical evidence seems to fit the present hypothesis better than other commonly held explanations of the adaptive function of territoriality, and the hypothesis

qualitative classification of habitats, while another past President, Alex Watt (1947) highlighted the dynamic nature of habitats by his phrase, 'pattern and process'. Elton referred to the need to
quantify habitat characteristics. In this Address I will attempt some quantification;however, you will all be aware that in doing this I will not be able to emulate those former Presidents who have
been able to provide a definitative synthesis of a field or of their own studies, my offering can be but a small beginning, an indication of the type of characteristics we should quantify. In

simple pattern. Theories must be pluralistic'. Indeed, the complexity of the subject is daunting and in any attempt to formulate some type of general framework, one is continually beset with
exceptions. In stressing the need for a framework I am echoing a plea of my predecessor Amyan Macfadyen (1975) who cited K. E. F. Watt's (1971) vivid image 'if we do not develop a strong theoretical
core that will bring all parts of ecology back together we shall all be washed out to sea in an immense tide of unrelated information'. In some ways I think we may see ourselves at a similar point to
the inorganic chemist before the development of the periodic table; then he could not predict, for example, how soluble a particular sulphate would be, or what was the likelihood of a particular
reaction occurring. Each fact had to be discovered for itself and each must be remembered in isolation. It is noteworthy that from Dobereiner's early efforts in 1816 it took more than fifty years
before Mendeleeff ormulated his Periodic Law (1869) and even after this there were various attempts at rearrangement. Another parallel may be drawn with astronomy before the development of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that relates the evolution and the properties of stars. Again in our own subject biology, the situation is somewhat analagous to that before the formulation of the Linnean

vary between four and 10 with an average of about six. The direct relationship between fecundity and adult mortality observed in natural populations is interpreted as reflecting primarily the density-

young will later be repaid. This repayment is derived from the predator feeding on the main competitors of the altruist.","McKaye, Kenneth R."
339,wade_experimental_1977,{AN} {EXPERIMENTAL} {STUDY} {OF} {GROUP} {SELECTION},1977-01-01,"Darwin (1878) suggested in The Origin of Species (p. 230-233) that selection between families or communities had given rise to sterile castes in the social insects. He argued that sterility could not
be favored directly by selection among individuals but that parents or communities might benefit, in terms of reproductive success, from the presence of sterile individuals. It is clear from his
arguments that Darwin believed that selection among groups could result in a change in the types of individuals within a species. It was much later that Wright (1931) perceived intergroup selection as
one of the primary forces controlling evolutionary change. He stated that the only practicable method of bringing about a rapid and non-self-terminating evolutionary advance would be through the
subdivision of populations into isolated and differentiating groups, among which selection could be practiced. Haldane (1932) and Wright (1945) both considered the case of the evolution of altruistic
behavior where individual selection acts against the altruist, but the altruist is favored by group selection. Group selection became a more controversial subject with the publication of Wynne-
Edwards' book Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior (1962). It was Wynne-Edwards' thesis that group selection was a general phenomenon and was responsible for the evolution of mechanisms
which regulated population size. Wynne-Edwards believed that population size was limited at some level below the ""carrying capacity"" (Errington, 1934) of the environment by means of individuals within
the population withholding reproduction. To the extent that an individual withholds reproduction that individual suffers a loss of fitness, where fitness is measured by reproductive success. It was
for this reason that WynneEdwards thought individual selection could not be responsible for the evolution of the mechanisms for withholding reproduction and therefore, some form of group selection was
required. Territoriality, ritualized aggression, the establishment of hierarchies and other social orderings, the onset of senility, and the optimum reproductive effort were some of the regulatory
mechanisms of populations that Wynne-Edwards proposed had evolved by means of group selection. The regulation of population size has been and continues to be an interesting and central problem in the
field of population ecology and several authors, among them Andrewartha and Birch (1954), Williams (1964), Hamilton (1966), and Amadon (1964) have cogently discussed the evolution of the above
mentioned regulatory mechanisms by means of individual selection. The focus of much of the controversy has been the question of whether or not group selection is required to explain the evolution of a
particular character. In general, the viewpoint of most ecologists and theorists has been that individual selection is a faster and more efficient form of natural selection than is group selection for
the following reasons: 1. In iteroparous species the generation time of the individual is short relative to the turnover time of the population and therefore selection proceeds faster when the unit of
selection is the individual. 2. The numbers of individuals greatly exceed the numbers of populations. If the units of selection are numerous it is less likely that chance events will significantly
influence the outcome of selection. There-","Wade, Michael J."

The population age-
structure was obtained by dissecting the standard length frequency distribution, a procedure which is justified in the text. Juveniles have an uncomplicated age-structure, the number of individuals in
successively later age-classes being reduced by mortality and by recruitment to the adult population. Among adult newts, the most frequent age-class is nearly central, indicating the existence of
extensive variation in the age at maturity. Growth continues throughout life, the rate of growth decreasing with age. The annual survival rate of adult newts as estimated by a census method, and from
the age-structure, was found to be =50\%, being rather greater in Y Y than in d d. Less reliable data indicate the annual survival rate of juveniles was -80\%. Maturity is attained between the ages of
3 and 7 yr, most individuals reproducing for the first time at 6 or 7 yr of age. The number of eggs laid increases with age from - 100 at age 3 to -400 at age 12; there is also an effect of Y age on
oocyte size, which may influence subsequent larval survival. Smooth newts breed annually. Reproduction diverts surplus energy from somatic growth, and thereby decreases potential future fecundity in
animals whose fecundity is proportional to body size. Individuals maturing at different ages, therefore, have different schedules of fecundity, which were estimated through the use of microbomb
calorimetry. Population size was found to be lognormally distributed, with a mean of -70. The sex ratio of juvenile newts was near equality, but a majority of Y Y comprised most adult populations.
This imbal- ance is due to greater mortality of adult d d, which results in an age-specific trend in the sex ratio. There are 2 breeding migrations: 1 in autumn and I in spring. It is likely that
newts migrate during autumn when about to reproduce for the first time, and thereafter migrate during spring. Terrestrial newts appear to move little; there is some evidence that colonization of newly
dug ponds is achieved by the infrequent emigration of juveniles. During its life, a smooth newt occupies a succession of ecological niches. Moreover, different individuals may occupy different niches,
or may occupy the same niches for different periods of time. It is speculated that in large newt populations the complex life history is able to trap genetic variation and to dampen fluctuations in
population size. However, it is suggested that these group attributes have arisen largely as the result of selection between individuals. Breeding only once (rather than repeatedly) will reduce
fitness because the additional fecundity necessary to balance the loss of later reproduction cannot be attained. Early maturity appears to be favored in d d, and late maturity in Y Y; these opposed
selection pressures may contribute to the observed age variation at maturity. Finally, the sex ratio does not vary with population density, and is therefore thought to be controlled by natural
selection.","Bell, Graham"
91,woolfenden_dominance_1977,Dominance in the {Florida} {Scrub} {Jay},1977-01-01,"Studies of intraspecific dominance abound in the ornithological literature, but relatively few are based on the activities of free-living birds. The study of captive flocks, and even of wild groups
attracted to feeding stations, may severely limit opportunities for discovering functions of dominance behavior in birds. Despite these limitations, several recent reports that in certain birds
dominance is closely related to territoriality are convincing (Brown 1963, Dixon 1965, Wiley 1973, Smith 1976). More commonplace hypotheses relate dominance to differential allocation of limited food
supplies (WynneEdwards 1962, Lack 1966: 284), though this relationship seems difficult to demonstrate in the field (despite Fretwell 1969). Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) typically
rear a single brood annually during a brief breeding season (Woolfenden 1973). Surviving offspring normally remain with their parents for at least one year during which they assist them in breeding
(Woolfenden 1975). Eventually many of these helpers establish themselves as breeders either by replacing lost breeders of neighboring families or by founding new territories.","Woolfenden, Glen E. and Fitzpatrick, John W."
367,wilson_structured_1977,Structured {Demes} and the {Evolution} of {Group}-{Advantageous} {Traits},1977-01-01,"1. Most organisms interact with a set of neighbors smaller than the deme (its trait group). Demes therefore are not only a population of individuals but also a population of groups (structured demes).
2. Trait groups vary in their composition. The minimum variance to be expected is that arising from a binomial distribution. Most populations have a higher variance than this due to (a) differential
interactions with the environment and (b) the effects of reproduction inside the trait groups. 3. As a consequence of this variation, an individual on the average experiences its own ""type"" in a
greater frequency than actually exists in the deme. Its behaviors are therefore directed differentially toward fellow types, and this is the fundamental requirement for the evolution of altruism. 4.
Models are presented for warning cries and other donor-recipient relations, resource notification, the evolution of prudence in exploitation and interference competition, and the effect of
differential trait-group extinction. In all cases evolution in structured demes differs from traditional individual-selection models. Individual selection corresponds to the case where there is zero
variance among trait groups, that is, complete homogeneity. 5. The ""threshold"" variance permitting the evolution of altruism (negative fitness change to the donor) is that arising from a binomial
distribution. As this is the minimum to be expected in nature, this theory predicts that at least weakly altruistic behavior should be a common occurrence (but see [9]). 6. If a population is
overexploiting its resource, a decrease in feeding rate through interference may be selected for given any trait-group variation. 7. When trait groups are composed entirely of siblings (i.e., kin
groups), the model is mathematically equivalent to kin selection. 8. As well as increasing population fitness, social systems may also evolve an ""immunity"" against group-detrimental types. 9. If a
given group-advantageous effect can be accomplished through both altruistic and selfish mechanisms, the selfish mechanism will be selected. A paucity of altruistic behaviors may signify that it is
usually possible to create the same result selfishly--not that altruism ""cannot"" be selected for","Wilson, David Sloan"

grounds. Skutch (1949) suggested that predation could determine optimum clutch size if the loss of nests to predators were to increase as brood size increases, hence as feeding visits, begging and
general activity about the nest increase. As Lack (1949) pointed out in response, whether predation or starvation is the principal cause of death, the optimum brood size is none the less that which

Some ecologists argue and others deny that the restricted
fluctuations in numbers observed in nature can be explained only by some form of density-dependent regulation (Nicholson, 1954; cf. Andrewartha and Birch, 1954; see also Ehrlich and Birch, 1967). Some
argue that animal numbers are usually limited by intraspecific competition for food (Lack, 1954a); others that once animals possess a piece of ground ‘they can do the actual food-getting in perfect
peace and freedom, entirely without inter-ference from rivals’ (Wynne-Edwards, 1962, p. 12). Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin (1960) argued that because most green matter falls to the ground uneaten, the
numbers of herbivores generally are not limited by food shortage; though in fact food may be limiting even when only a small fraction of the stock is eaten (Huf-faker, 1966). Many believe that
‘predation is centred upon over-produced young … upon what is identifiable as the more biologically expendable parts of the population’ (Errington, 1963, p. 184); yet Pearson (1971) suggests that
carnivore predation alone is ‘responsible for the amplitude and timing of the microtine cycle’. Ehrlich and Birch (1967) expect regulatory factors to vary among populations of the same species and
through time; while Chitty (1958), Watson and Moss (1970), and Krebs and Myers (1974) seek one ‘universal explanation’ for what prevents unlimited increase in small mammals. If there is any

feature of breeding biology, and is now known to involve at least 1.5 per cent of the world’s avifauna. I hold co-operative breeders to include the many birds with ‘helpers at the nest’, and the
several species which breed in pairs but are group-territorial and provision the young communally, as well as the few in which several females lay in a common nest. For reasons given below we should
exclude the half-dozen species that cooperate in building a supernest in which each pair rears its young unaided — those are best designated communal nesters. I include, however, birds in which later
broods in the same season are regularly fed by their siblings of earlier broods, since this seems similar to their retaining family bonds and, when adult, helping parents at the nest in subsequent
years. Details of social organisation and the nature of the co-operative effort vary considerably with species; they typically involve pre-breeding adult individuals helping a breeding pair with nest
building, incubation, territorial defence, feeding nestlings and attending fledglings.","Fry, C. H."

utilization; a generalized version of the ""functional response curve""; impact on vegetation and scramble competition; reproduction and survival schedules; predation; habitat utilization and contest
competition. Our basic hypothesis is that the major features of the population dynamics of the field vole may be understood by analyzing the ""condition"" of individual organisms, particularly their
nutritional balance. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the models with respect to realism, thus showing that many observations on free-living field vole populations may be explained by these models.

General problems in testing fitness differences are briefly discussed. It is pointed out that two
different interpretations of Chitty's theory are common in literature: One states that regular density oscillations are caused by genetically based behavioural polymorphism in the absence of extrinsic
changes; the other that regular cycles are the result of the interaction between genetic changes and extrinsic factors. Only the latter is concluded plausible. However, further empirical research
attempting to test the hypothesized lower general fitness of the aggressive strategies is needed. Genetic changes in parasites may, on the basis of preliminary theoretical studies, be presumed likely
to result in cycles. More experimental work is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. Genetic feedback interactions between predator-prey interactions are likely to be rejected as unimportant for
generating limit cycles. Exceptions may be predator-prey interactions in simple habitat complexes and possibly in the optimal area of the prey's distribution range. Female biased sex ratios is

caused a net decrease in population size. An abundant food supply stimulated population growth. A lifetable indicated that mortality differed markedly according to age and sex, and that this pattern
was not attributable to predation or disease alone. Behavioral analysis revealed that 81.5\% of all threats occurred during foraging. Threatened individuals were prevented from feeding, and their
foods were usurped directly in 36\% of all threat interactions. The observed frequency of threats between age-sex classes during foraging differed significantly from two progressively stronger null
hypotheses. These hypotheses took into account, respectively, the age-sex distribution of the society, and the frequencies of nearest neighbor associations between animals of different age and sex.
The agonistic discrimination between animals of different age and sex was mirrored by a similar affiliative discrimination. Some conclusions of this analysis were that adults dominated the juveniles
which in turn dominated the infants, and among juveniles and infants males dominated their female peers. Adults likewise discriminated against the young females. The behavioral relationships during
foraging influenced the foraging efficiency of animals, which was measured by the amount of time spent in foraging, feeding rates, and the quality of foods that were consumed. By these measures adult
males fared best, then adult females, then juvenile males, and juvenile females fared worst. I proposed that as a consequence of these behaviorally imposed feeding efficiencies, young animals died at
greater rates than adults, and infant and juvenile females died at greater rates than their male peers; behaviorally mediated access to other resources is likely to influence mortality in a similar

Pembrokeshire is described and a general account of what is already known of the breeding biology of the Manx Shearwater is provided as a background to the more detailed studies described in the
present work which was continued over five breeding seasons, 1973-1977. In Chapter 2 I demonstrate that male and female Manx Shearwaters differed in the length of their bills and tarsi but not in wing
length. However most of the chapter is concerned with the weights and measurements of shearwaters, most of which were of known age but unknown sex, caught at the colony by night. In 1973 and 1974 the
weight of all age groups was highest in March and then declined to a minimum in June and July. Weight increased slightly in August. It was generally true that the older a bird was, the heavier it was
in any particular month, and this effect appeared to hold good until the birds were 8-10 years old. Unlike weight, bill and wing length did not alter with age. The implications of these results are
discussed in the light of current hypotheses concerning the delayed onset of breeding shown by many seabirds including the Manx Shearwater. In the pre-laying period, covered by Chapter 3, both male
and female Manx Shearwaters lost weight up until about two weeks before laying. Males lost weight more rapidly than females and this was related to the fact that males visited the burrow more
regularly. In the two weeks prior to laying the male continued regularly to visit the burrow at night but the female was virtually absent from the colony; it appears that she may travel into the Bay
of Biscay to feed during this period of absence. In the pre-laying period the weight of breeding birds was not different from the weight of birds which have bred formerly but which were not known to
be breeding during the current season. However, breeding birds tended to be heavier than birds which started to breed in a future year. To test the possibility that young birds may be prevented from
breeding by a shortage of burrows artificial burrows were dug, and some were occupied by young birds, probably breeding for the first time. A burrow-blocking experiment was also carried out. The
possibility that competition for burrows was greater in an area of higher as opposed to lower burrow density was investigated by comparing the pre-laying attendance pattern of breeders in the two
areas. No difference was found. Chapter 4 shows that the breeding success of newly-formed pairs was lower than that of established pairs, mostly because newly-formed pairs were less successful at
incubation. The lower success of new pairs was not due to the new pairing per se but to the fact that such new pairs tended to include birds without previous breeding experience. Thus experienced
birds may avoid the disadvantageous consequences (to breeding success) of forming a new pair if they mate with another experienced bird, and this they did. Divorce and change of breeding burrow were
both more likely after a breeding failure than a success. Both the laying date and egg volume of individual female Manx Shearwaters varied little from year to year, once the first few years of
breeding were passed. I am unable to reconcile this finding with Perrins' (1970) suggestion that the laying date of the female Manx Shearwater is determined by the difficulties she may encounter early
in the season in building up sufficient food reserves to form the egg. Instead I propose that, although early laying would be advantageous from the point of view of chick survival (Perrins 1966), the
shearwaters do not lay earlier because of the difficulties that would be encountered in successfully incubating an early egg. Evidence supporting this idea is presented. In each of the four study
years the fledging weight of chicks declined as the season progressed, as described in Chapter 5. Various lines of evidence, including an egg-swapping experiment, support the view that this decline
was mostly due to a deterioration of feeding conditions late in the season, rather than to a tendency for parents less proficient at rearing heavy young to breed later. It seems that date of fledging
and weight at fledging may both influence the fledgling's chances of survival but I am unable to determine the relative importance of these two factors. Different pairs of shearwaters differed in
their ability to feed chicks, but chick-feeding performance was not related to age or breeding experience. Chapter 6 evaluates the parameters necessary for the construction of a life table. Of the
chicks which fledge from Skokholm at least 25andnbsp;\% survive to breed on Skokholm, whilst adult survival is about 90andnbsp;\%. About 20andnbsp;\% of those adults known to be alive and to have bred
previously do not breed in any one year- The age of first breeding, currently about six, has increased over the past ten or fifteen years. Among the birds which have been ringed as chicks on Skokholm
and which bred there during the study period there was a 2:1 ratio of males to females. I suggest that about half the females fledging from Skokholm settle to breed in other colonies. The body
measurements (used as an indicator of sex) and abundance of Skokholm-ringed birds on nearby Skomer Island support this hypothesis. The Manx Shearwater life table is therefore constructed to take
account of immigration to and emigration from the Skokholm colony. Recruitment to the breeding population and loss by mortality are roughly equal. Chapter 7 shows that the calls given by male and
female Manx Shearwaters were different. The response of other shearwaters to these calls was investigated by means of playback experiments. Females recognized the calls of their male mates but I am
unable to show a selective response of males to the calls of their female mates. This difference is considered to be related to the different roles of the two sexes and to be associated with the fact
that most calls heard from the ground were given by males whilst most calls uttered in flight were probably given by females. There is no evidence that nestlings can recognize the calls of their
parents. The value of colonial breeding is considered in the concluding Chapter 8. It seems that Manx Shearwaters in the dense Main Colony experienced a lower rate of predation, but they did not have
greater reproductive success than those breeding in areas of lower burrow density elsewhere on the island. Although nesting habitat on Skokholm is not fully utilised there may be a limited supply of
breeding burrows available. This would create competition for burrows which, together with competition for food, is suggested as an important influence on the breeding biology of the Manx Shearwater.
There are four appendices. The first shows that birds first caught in the colony at two years old were caught earlier in the year when three years old than those which were caught for the first time
at three. Similarly, birds which have been caught when two or three years old were caught earlier in the year when four years old than those birds which were caught for the first time at four. These
differences in time of return to the colony appear not to be associated with sex. Appendix 2 discusses the relationship between the body size of offspring and their parents. In the Manx Shearwater it
appears that about three-quarters of the phenotypic variance of body size is due to genetic causes, and may therefore be inherited. Appendix 3 describes a simple experiment designed to test the
possibility that vision may be one sense used by Manx Shearwaters attempting to locate their breeding burrow. The result of the experiment was positive but more extensive tests would be required to
assess the relative roles of vision and any other senses that may be employed in burrow location. Appendix 4 describes an unsuccessful visit to the Basque coast of northern Spain to assess the status
of the Manx Shearwater in the south-east corner of the Bay of Biscay in the pre-laying period, late April. I tentatively suggest that it is only in exceptional circumstances that many shearwaters feed
south of about 46° N.","Brooke, M."

inactive and in physical contact with each other. At the beginning of flood tide and near the end of ebb tide, the hermit crabs disperse on upper boulder and other surfaces and feed. When water depths
become greater than 0.7 m, the hermit crabs refuge under boulders and in crevices, remaining loosely spaced. The sites of refuging and clustering may differ, and the cluster site may be on a boulder
adjacent to the refuge site. Thirteen monthly transects on two different substrates, boulder and shell-hash beachrock, are utilized to detail clustering trends. In both habitats, highly significant

The influences of social, spatial and population density parameters on agonistic behavior in the adult male wolf spider Schizocosa crassipes were analyzed. Social density varied the number of
spiders present (N = 2, 3 or 5) in different spatial densities (U =90, 180, 270 or 450 cm 2 ). Population density varied the amount of space available per animal, irrespective of social and spatial
density. 2. Multiple stepwise discriminant analysis revealed differences among the social, spatial and population density groups on the basis of the number and kinds of agonistic behaviors displayed.
3. As social density increased, the number of agonistic interactions increased. Although the spiders did not interact more frequently with any one partner over 10 days, they continued to respond
differentially to one another with regard to established dominance-subordinance relations. 4. Within each spatial density, the amount of space had no effect on the total number of agonistic
interactions. However, within each social density, the number of agonistic interactions varied according to the amount of space available. In less restricted spatial densities, agonistic interactions
increased with the number of spiders. 5. The absolute distance maintained between spiders increased proportionally with spatial density. However, when distances were expressed as a percentage of the
maximum possible distance between any two animals, spiders tested in the largest spatial density exhibited decreasing inter-individual distances over time, while those tested in the smallest spatial
density exhibited increasing distances. These findings suggested social attraction among the spiders when sufficient space was available. 6. As population density increased the number of agonistic
interactions increased. However, no differences in the number of interactions between specific partners occurred. 7. By comparing Equal and Low population density groups, an estimate of the personal
space of male S. crassipes was calculated to be 5.35 cm, which agreed with field and laboratory observations. 8. When spiders are grouped within certain spatial limits, various types of agonistic
behaviors serve to space the animals according to their personal distance. High population density may interfere with communicatory behavior patterns which in turn may weaken dominance-subordinance
relationships.","Aspey, Wayne P."

cooperative, in which the probabilities of transmission of the genes of all participants are similarly affected by the outcome, and (2) agonistic, in which the probabilities for the participants are
affected in opposite directions. The latter are of particular interest for evolutionary theory. Three major types of designs for measuring social behavior in genetic experiments are available: (1)
homogeneous sets, (2) standard tester and (3) tester panel representing a reference population. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed. Important areas for future development

selective factors favoring Podger in alaxensis birds. Bachelor males should establish territories only if differential food availability between habitats has been an important factor favoring Podger.
Bachelor males should not establish territories when differential protection from predation afforded by potential nesting substrates has been the primary selective factor. Previously published
evidence is shown to be consistent with these predictions. It is suggested that vegetation structure as a defense against nest predation should be of paramount importance in determining habitat
quality for colonial species, whereas food availability should be a more important factor for non colonial species. It was found that all species in which bachelor males defend territories are
noncolonial, and nearly all species in which bachelor males do not defend territories are colonial. This correlation supports the conclusions derived from the model and suggests two ways that Podger
evolved in alaxensis birds. In colonial species Podger apparently evolved because a limited availability of safe nesting sites can be defended by a fraction of the total male population. Many females
can only occupy these sites by mating with already mated males. In noncolonial species polygyny apparently evolved because a combination of physiognomie differences and differential food availability
between optimal and marginal habitats enables secondary (second-mated) females in optimal habitat to be as successful as monogamous females in marginal habitat. Polygyny probably evolved in a few
species because females are unable to determine the mated status of males, and the Orians-Verner model is inapplicable in these Cases.","Wittenberger, James F."

suggested or implied that unless social controls manifest themselves entirely through freely exercised individual choice they are undesirable. Such an attitude is highly noticeable in the current
debate over the population explosion. While it is both understandable and laudable as part of the struggle against political oppression, a moment's reflection should clarify that we are nevertheless
dealing with an absurd proposition. There is every reason to consider means and methods of social controls, in particular their imposition through common consent, but hardly their very justification.
As a highly social animal, man depends on orderly, that is, controlled social interaction for his survival. Moreover, there is reason to believe that such controls exert themselves regardless of our
notions about them. In its most general form the case for social or behavioural population control is contained in Malthus' famous dictum that there is ""a constant tendency in all animated life to

were independent of the ability of individual human beings to survive and reproduce, I am also leery of attempts by biologists to explain the consistencies between neo-Darwinian theory and cultural
behavior as the result of natural selection for that behavior. Instead, I propose that both biological and cultural attributes of human beings result to a large degree from the selective retention of
traits that enhance the inclusive fitnesses of individuals in their environments. Aspects of human biology and culture may be adaptive in the same sense despite differences between the mechanisms of
selection and regardless of their relative importance in the evolution of a trait. The old idea that organic and cultural evolution are complementary can thus be used to provide new explanations for

effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living
in specified circumstances. First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in its
lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality, the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of the
parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations,
selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status, or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should be
delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease in size with increased resource availability. Theorists have
also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated
early in life, and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care, and small reproductive efforts should be
favored (K-selection). In fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But another view holds
that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments that test the assumptions and
predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination of different definitions of fitness.","Stearns, Stephen C."

Woodpecker is a unique, social species resident in the oak belt of western North, Central and South America. Individuals live and breed cooperatively, defend stores of acorns (each acorn tightly
fitted into a woodpecker-made socket) and collectively defend a year-round territory which includes the nest tree(s), storage tree(s), and oaks which supply the mast (Myers 1923, Leach 1925, Ritter

discuss the evolution of the cooperative group. The transition is the result of a mutation of the dynamics of cell division, delayed cell separation leads to colonies of four cells. With this mutation
cooperative features appear, such as synchronised cell divisions within colonies and coordinated flagellar function which enables the colony to swim in definite directions. The selective advantages
under given, environmental conditions are defined and the periods necessary for complete allelic replacement in small populations are calculated for asexual and sexual reproduction. The assumption of
a steady-state population during allelic substitution is critically considered, particularly under conditions of competition. It is shown that density-dependent population control must operate in the
process of selection. Sexual reproduction slows down the rate of selection even though all cells dre haploid. This phenomenon can be explained in general terms of `organizational dominance', where
individual units coordinate the function of their neighbours which may be of a different allelotype.Cooperativity is pointed out as an a priori systemic feature which resides in the sub-units of
systems, group formation and coordination appears thus as an almost inevitable event. A particular type of system described as ‘closed cycle of positive fitness interaction’ is discussed in more
detail. It has the remarkable feature that its members cannot compete with each other; selection takes place between whole cycles (in analogy to Eigen's 1971 model).Gonium has a wide spectrum of
`somatic plasticity' which enables it to assume various colonial configurations depending on physiological and environmental conditions. This feature can be explained as the result of dynamic
flexibilities on the macro-molecular level. The particular relationship between the vast, molecular complexity and the relative simple dynamics of the cell cycle must lead eventually to the genetic
fixation of an environmentally induced phenotype.","Walker, I. and Williams, R. M."

environmental predictability. It assumes that natural selection results in parents adjusting resource investment per offspring in a manner which achieves the highest ratio of offspring fitness per
unit of parental resource expended, given a certain relationship between the expected fitness of individual offspring and the investment per offspring. This fitness-resource relation can be
constructed from knowledge or models of the frequency distribution of parental resource utilized by individual offspring in the population and from the nature of the competitive process. Model
examples are given based on assumptions concerning territorial quality, and on the rules of the game governing contests for resources. These models of interference lead to strong optimization for high
expenditures of resource per offspring. The mortality regime, by affecting the severity of competition, should affect the optimal level of allocation and result in selection for birth rates which seem
to compensate for mortality. Environmental instability can lead to selection for parental mechanisms which increase growth variation in offspring and achieve a more optimal resource distribution. The
theory thus explains how natural selection on individual parents can lead to population control through regulation of birth rates and behavioral mechanisms which seem to prevent overcrowding and
starvation. Only fragmentary evidence for testing the theory is available.","Brockelman, Warren Y."

It is difficult enough to study the effects of crowding on rodents, in which genetically homogeneous strains may be used, the environment to which the animal is exposed may be precisely controlled,

N. zostericola is a monotelic species which spawns from 2
to 5 times over a period of 2 weeks at the end of its 1-year life span. The gonads consist of plates of cells bulging from beneath the peritoneum in the thoracic region of the body. Oogenesis has been
divided into 3 phases: an ovarian phase in which gametogonia and primary oocytes are retained within the ovary, a follicular phase, in which oocytes are ovulated into the coelom surrounded by several
layers of follicle cells and the vitellogenic phase, where individual oocytes rupture through the follicle cells and enter the coelomic fluid where cell growth and yolk synthesis occur. The combined
ovarian and follicular phases have a duration of about 3 to 5 weeks and the vitellogenic phase about 5 to 6 months. Vitellogenesis is described on the ultrastructural level. Yolk synthesis involves
the participation of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum of the oocyte in possible combination with nutrient absorption from the coelomic fluid. Spermatogenesis involves the rupturing of
masses of spermatogonia into the coelom from the testis, surrounded by peritoneal cells. Smaller clusters of spermatocytes are later released into the coelomic fluid where mitotic and meiotic
divisions eventually produce flattened plates of sperm. The mature spermatozoan possesses an elongate head, atypical for most polychaetes.","Eckelbarger, K. J."

resulting high attachment needs, and the prolongation of development phases. Unsuccessful resolution of the oedipal phase may result when the mother's dominant status is lowered. The authors suggest

limits, which perceptually represents the possible input from the environment and whether the organism can handle this input. Thus, animals that cannot synthesize light signals into three-dimensional
images differ anatomically and physiologically from those that can. Much of the discussion of culture presents comparative material from man and the lower animals. Many examples can only be analogies,
since comparable work is not available for man-either because it has not yet been done or because it cannot properly be done within ethical limitations. The use of such evidence derives from the
fundamental assumption that there is a continuity of process across species, however significant the differences in detail. Provided one is careful to establish both the similarities and the
differences, extrapolations can be a fruitful guide to hypotheses which can be experimentally tested. The beststudied and perhaps the most striking such analogy (but in no sense the only one) is the
way in which spatial distance is utilized not merely to make interaction possible, but also to set in motion particular emotional-interactional patterns, specifically the initiative and dominance
variables. The investigation of culture might properly be called cultural anthropology (or for that matter, social anthropology, if these terms are considered equivalent-as they are not in England,
for example) provided its area of concern is distinguished from behavioral anthropology as here defined. This investigation is twofold. First, it is built upon a systematic use of the science of
learning, dependent to a large extent upon, but by no means limited by, what psychology has so far contributed. Second, it concentrates on the logical systems special to each of the cultural
dimensions into which culture can be divided. These logical systems are based on criteria other than those of the natural sciences. The assumptions-and the logical combinations which result-may be
economic or mechanical, or both, in the case of the technology of the work flow; they may be perceptual and architectural in the case of space. In communication, there are logical systems based on
color and form, on properties of sound and rhythm, on symbolic logic or visual concordance. Combining these two main areas of inquiry, cultural anthropology can explicitly concern itself with the
constraints within which the human animal lives, constraints which one can no more exclude from the behavioral side than one can study a fish as a functioning organism and ignore the ocean within
which he swims. FOUNDATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL","Mark, Albyn and Chapple, Eliot D."

applicability to the study of behavior. Efforts at general theories based on reflex concepts, or simple movements such as in orientation, have been unsuccessful in dealing with complex behaviors.
Recent arguments that selection is focused at the level of the individual organism suggest the additional inadequacy that such theories fail to emphasize the selective compromises that exist at
suborganismic levels. Evolutionary theories about behavior have tended to concentrate chiefly on patterns of historical change (phylogenies) without stressing adaptive (= reproductive) strategies, or
have generally viewed adaptiveness erroneously as focused at group, population, or species levels. Human society is discussed briefly, in a context of selection focused at the individual level,

As literature on the subject makes clear, a universal diffidence on the part of practitioners, often coupled with attitudinal bias on the part of the social scientist, has served as justification for
inattention. Consideration of specific forms of population control must precede a more sophisticated understanding of the alternative control strategies available to human populations in specific
ecological contexts. This review underlines the great potential impact of infanticide as a means of population regulation with social structural implications. Ignoring exceptional and idiosyncratic
forms of the practice, I focus here on those cases in which cultural norms raise it to demographically significant frequencies. After reviewing the few existing surveys, I explore potential

longevity, movements, and home range, as well as their functional role in northern shrub-steppe habitat. During 41,310 trap-nights we captured 15,386 mice representing seven species: Perognathus
parvus, Peromyscus maniculatus, Onychomys leuco- gaster, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Lagurus curtatus, Microtus montanus, and Sylvilagus nut- tallii. Pocket mice accounted for 91\%, deer mice 8\%, and
the remaining species only 1\% of the captures. Most pocket mice remained inactive underground between December and February. Adult e became trappable at an average date of 26 March; 9 9 emerged about
18 April. Once active, adults remained trappable for an average of 60 days in years of average-to-excellent food production, and for 90 days in years of poor production. Sex ratios of trappable
animals differed significantly from 1:1 in about half the sampling periods, and usually favored adult . Males had scrotal testes for an average of 4 mo, with the highest proportion in April. The first
signs of estrus were observed in April, the first palpable pregnancies in May, and the last pregnant 9 9 usually in July. In years of high food availability adult 9 9 averaged 2 litters; in average
years they had 1.1 litters; and in poor years, only one 9 in three became pregnant. The average size of three litters found in live-traps was 3.7. In 1969, a year of excellent food production,
juveniles from early litters bred during late summer. Subadults were first trapped in June for an average of 40-70 days. Survival from weaning to the following breeding season ranged between 56\%-58\%
(1967, 1970) and 80\% (1968); 17\%-19\% survived to the 3rd yr; and 2\%-3\% survived to the 4th yr. The highest overwintering success was in juveniles born during the year of lowest precipitation,
poorest food supply, and reduced reproduction. Differential survival affected the age distribu- tion of animals during the breeding season. One-year-olds dominated the breeding populations in 1968 and
1970; but in 1969 only 55\% of the breeders were born the preceding year. The age distribution had little apparent effect on the reproductive success of the population. Perognathus parvus ceased
aboveground activities between late summer and autumn de- pending upon environmental conditions, sex, and age. Population size was estimated by means of the Jolly-Seber stochastic model which helped
interpret population responses when components of the population were not trappable. The peak autumnal population varied about a mean of 320 animals with only a twofold variation between the estimates
for the lowest (206, 1968) and the highest (437, 1969) years. Within years the greatest variation was a fivefold increase in numbers observed between the early breeding season and fall population peak
of 1969. The estimated summer population size showed a high degree of correlation with the amount of precipitation falling between October and April, precipitation that largely stimulated growth and
reproduction in vegetation, which in turn affected the small-mammal population. Adult 8 8 had larger home ranges (1,560-4,005 m2) than 9 9 (508-2,301 m2); adults had larger home ranges than subadults.
Home ranges were largest in years of average-to-excellent food production and moderate population densities; they were smallest either in years of poor resources and moderate population densities or
in years of average resources but high densities.","O'Farrell, Thomas P. and Olson, Richard J. and Gilbert, Richard O. and Hedlund, John D."

A fundamental problem is whether mortality is fixed and natality dependent, or vice versa (von Haartman 1971).
For instance, WynneEdwards (1962) argued that either side of the population equation may vary. Yapp (1970) suggested that mortality is more or less constant and that natality varies and Lack (1954,
1966), von Haartman (1971), and others, indicated that variations in mortality are most important in the regulation of numbers. Clearly, there is a need to document rates of natality and mortality in
natural populations, especially where they can be related to the state of the populations. I will consider clutch size, fertility and hatchability of eggs, and nesting success of Blue Grouse
(Dendragapus obscurus). All concern the natality side of the above controversy. Several colleagues and I have conducted intensive population studies of Blue Grouse almost continuously from 1962-1973

1962-1973 breeding populations have shown both stability and change. From 1962-1965, breeding densities were stable at a relatively low level (Zwickel and Bendell 1967, unpubl. data). From 19691971
breeding densities increased steadily (Zwickel 1972) and have now stabilized at about the 1971 level, approximately 40\% higher than in the period 1962-1965. These factors allow a comparison of

GB-7280, GB-17028, and GB-24818 and by a general research grant from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Medawar (1952) set forth an evolutionary theory of senescence based on concepts of
adaptive demography; later, Hamilton (1966) and Charlesworth (1973) corrected and clarified mathematical aspects of Medawar's theory. Variants of the theory, based on similar demographic
considerations but invoking different genetic explanations, have been proposed by Williams (1957, 1966), Edney and Gill (1968), and Guthrie (1969). The virtue of the approach used by all of these
authors is that it views senescence not as a pathological condition but, rather, as just one component of an organism's life history. Insofar as life-history attributes are adaptive, senescence may be
an integral part of an adapted constellation of characters.","Mertz, David B."

argue, largely because the researchers in these fields have tended to be too specialized. Demography, a science rooted in occidental economics and sociology, is oriented toward the study of
industrializing and industrialized societies, societies which are by no means representative of the entire range of human societies. Anthropologists, although they have dealt with a wider range of
human societies, have tended to neglect the potential theoretical contributions of population ecology, the study of the population dynamics of nonhuman animals. The theory of human population dynamics
which I offer here was developed with the value of generality and broad scope constantly in mind. The roots of this theory are in General Systems Theory, population ecology, ethnology, demography, and
economics. I propose this population theory largely as a means of encouraging, within all of those sciences concerned with population matters, a new round of debate regarding existing population
theories.","Blanton, Richard E."

The display of age-specific death rates usually takes
the form of an abridged life table; fertility rates are rarer in the literature. One recent compendium has discussed the construction of life tables for skeletal populations (Acsádi and Nemeskéri
1970). In another work, I have argued that the fragmentary nature of anthropological data and the problems of sampling from small populations required the use of various smoothing techniques in order
to make the construction of life tables and vital rates meaningful (Weiss 1973); in that work, I suggested the use of stable population theory as a means of data smoothing, and a set of model life
tables based on that theory were determined for use with fragmentary demographic data. Both direct and indirect means of constructing life tables and vital rates from anthropological data involve
inference from a census and very little additional data, since that is usually all that is available to us.","Weiss, Kenneth M."

of the event for an observer. The term “aggression” is a clear example of the latter type of description. It is a judgment which has an imperfect and only partially known correspondence to the spatio-
temporal “facts” of physical science. Furthermore, the functional significance of the same event might be judged very differently by different observers. Even a panel of physicists does not always
agree on how to describe an event. But it would be even more foolhardy to hope for perfect agreement between the judgments of (a) the initiator of an attack, invasion, intrusion, provocation, or
fight; (b) the recipient of that act; (c) a judge from the same social community; (d) a panel of judges from other societies of the same species; and (e) the behavioral scientist who tries to describe
aggressive events as if he were a total outsider watching creatures from a different planet. In many cases, even a judge cannot easily decide who was the initiator or what were the hostilities.","Menzel, E. W."

The number of species and individuals in the flocks were approximately linearly correlated. Certain species occurred
almost only in the largest flocks. All species except one showed significant foraging preferences for certain tree species. Consequently woodland stands of different taxonomic composition supported
partly different species constellations. Bird flock diversity was correlated with the number of tree and shrub species, with the structural complexity of the forest and, secondarily with the openness
of the stand. Total forest diversification was quantified in terms of topoelements including both taxonomic and structural vegetational complexity. It is argued that these two factors and direct
sociability play different roles for the different species forming the flocks. Multispecies flocks permit the formation of large groups for antipredator protection without causing too many individuals
of a species to occur within a small area.","Ulfstrand, S."

for a  complete year. Quantitatives sampling techniques were  developed which allowed several animals' behaviour to  be simultaneously recorded.  Surveys were conducted in three areas of different
botanical and topographical structure and censuses  performed both at the beginning and end of the study.  Some behavioural properties of a population of Indri  were investigated in one study site by
collecting data  on vocal interactions between approximately 40 groups.  The maintenance activities of the species are  described and assessed. Seasonal and individual  variation in behaviour are
compared both in the groups  studied and with other species. Social behaviour is  analysed (1) by measures of animal interaction and  (2) in terms of the inter-dependence of some individuals'
behaviour with others. Measures of spacing and feeding  are shown to be suitable to this approach. Evidence for  the territoriality of the species is presented and its  adaptive qualities considered.
The roles of territory  definition, declaration and occupation are contrasted  and compared. The development of behaviour in infant  and juvenile Indri is examined in terms of individual  and social
adaptations. Some facets of ecological and  social differentiation with Indri society are proposed.","Pollock, J."

Its general aims were set out by Dunnet \& Patterson
(1968), who suggested that in north-east Scotland rook populations experienced their most serious food shortage during the summer. Lockie (1956), on the other hand, inferred from observations on food-
fighting within flocks near Oxford that winter was critical. Patterson (1970) found that, within the Ythan Valley, fighting over food was most frequent during winter, particularly during snow when
feeding sites became restricted, and this raised the problem whether fighting in rook flocks was a reliable indication of general food shortage, or whether it was a response to the high density of
birds at localized feeding sites. Intense localization could result in some individuals getting insufficient food because they could not find space at the feeding sites, even though food might be
superabundant there. As Lockie (1956a) pointed out, the establishment of a hierarchy through competition at feeding sites could ensure that the majority of the population obtained its daily food
requirement, with only the most subordinate birds starving at any one time. In this situation, therefore, feeding space rather than food abundance would impose food shortage in some individuals. An
alternative, with food being widely distributed but generally scarce, thereby imposing difficulties on all individuals within the population, appeared to be the situation (in the Ythan Valley) during
the summer (Dunnet \& Patterson 1968). These two kinds of food shortage would affect the individuals of a population in different ways and pose different problems for birds searching for food. Ward
(1965) and Zahavi (1971) suggested that communal roosting was an adaptation to help individuals to discover localized feeding sites. As rooks roost communally it was decided to make observations which
would distinguish between the two kinds of food shortage, and to see how the birds reacted to them, especially in terms of roosting behaviour and dispersal from roosts. The specific aims of this study
were therefore: (i) to describe seasonal changes in the crop types available to the birds; (ii) to measure daily food intake at different times of year; (iii) to relate this to the daily food
requirement of a captive rook in order to identify periods of food shortage in the field; and (iv) to observe variations in roosting behaviour and in dispersal from roosts. The study area consisted of
about 10 sq. miles (c. 2500 ha) of arable land, comprising the common feeding areas of two rookeries, South Artrochie and Macharmuir, at Auchmacoy, near Newburgh, Aberdeenshire (Fig. 1). Spring sown

Individual organisms compete for representation of their genes in future generations. The genomes of those individuals better
able to survive and reproduce occur in higher frequencies. This process of natural selection working at the level of individual organisms is capable of explaining the vast majority of adaptations of
species to their environment. There are, however, a significant minority of characters which are difficult to explain by this mechanism. The evolution of such diverse phenomena as social behavior in
hymenopterous and isopterous insects, warning calls in birds and even sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, cannot readily be explained by natural selection operating at the level of individuals. In
general, characters which benefit the group as a whole, but are selectively neutral or deleterious to the bearers, fail to conform to the requirements for individual natural selection. Either for want
of a better term, or because of its anthropocentric appeal, this class of characters have become known as altruistic. Two primary mechanisms have been used to explain the evolution of altruistic
characters: kin selection and interdemic selection. Both of these processes require some form of non-random association among the individual members of the population. For this reason they have been
appropriately combined under the general heading of group selection (see Wilson, 1973). Kin selection groups are composed of individuals of common ancestry. Interdemic selection groups are spatially
or temporaly bounded subsets of the population forming primarily endogamous breeding units or","Levin, Bruce R. and Kilmer, William L."
2183,alexander_evolution_1974,The {Evolution} of {Social} {Behavior},1974-01-01,"For several years the study of social behavior has been undergoing a revolution with far-reaching consequences for the social and biological sciences. Partly responsible are three recent changes in
the attitudes of evolutionary biologists. First was growing acceptance of the evidence that the potency of natural selection is overwhelmingly concentrated at levels no higher than that of the
individual. Second was revival of the comparative method, especially as applied to behavior and life histories. Third was spread of the realization that not only are all aspects of structure and
function of organisms to be understood solely as products of selection, but because of their peculiarly direct relationship to the forces of selection, behavior and life history phenomena, long
neglected by the evolutionists, may be among the most predictable of all phenotypic attributes. These ideas have been appreciated by a few biologists for a long time, but they have only recently begun
to characterize the science as a whole. Darwin’s discussion of sterility between species as an incidental effect of evolutionary adaptation (41, p. 260) and his refusal to deal with sex ratio
selection (42, p. 399) suggest awareness of the difficult problem of determining the levels at which selection is most powerful. Yet significant clarification of this basic issue did not really
commence until publication of Wynne-Edwards’ massive volume (179) championing group selection and inadvertently exposing its unlikelihood. As late as 1958, Fisher felt constrained to add to the
revised edition of his 1929 classic, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, the admonishment (53, p. 49) that his fundamental theorem and its associated considerations, already misused then by
decades of population geneticists dealing (as they saw it) with the fitness of populations, refer strictly to ""the progressive modification of structure or function only in so far as variations in
these are ofadvantage to the individual... [and afford] no corresponding explanation for any properties of animals and plants.., supposed to be of service to the species to which they belong.""
Williams’ critique (171) provided a significant turning point. Nevertheless, one has only to pick up any biological journal or attend any biological meeting to realize that this question has not yet
been settled for all","Alexander, Richard D."

stability for any animal is conveniently expressed by τ/H (τ = generation time and H = the length of time the habitat remains suitable for food harvesting). In animals whose habitats have a value of
τ/H approaching unity, one generation will not affect the resources available to the next. The strategy for these habitats can allow overshooting of the equilibrium. In animals with permanent habitats
(τ/H very small), overshooting, with the consequent overexploitation of resources, will be selected against. The logistic equation cannot represent a situation that involves overshooting. A more
realistic approach arises from the consideration of the difference equation (2) which includes a time delay between density-dependence acting and the subsequent population change. Its three basic
parameters are the equilibrium population (N*), the finite growth rate of the population (λ), and the density-dependent moderator (b), which is related to the return time (Tr = 1/b) near equilibrium.
Characteristics of successful r- and K-strategists are investigated using the model and conclusions summarized above. While we accept that many vertebrates may have arisen as a result of K-selection
(in comparatively stable geological periods), many groups within these taxa will have their population parameters modified toward those characteristics for the type of habitat they occupy (table 1).
Really successful K-strategists become precisely adapted to a very permanent (in generation terms) habitat type, they become larger in size, and, because of their extreme K-type population parameters,
they lose their plasticity for selection. When their habitats change owing to major environmental variations in geological time, these species become extinct. This, we suggest, is the ecological
explanation of Cope's rule.","Southwood, T. R. E. and May, R. M. and Hassell, M. P. and Conway, G. R."

replaced themselves, and an area of mixed shrubs and grasses where they did not. Surplus squirrels from the lawn raised the population density off the lawn. Also, habitat suitabilities varied with
population densities. Hence, densities in the two areas were not proportional to habitat preferences. Before the reduction the population density fluctuated widely but the mean change for 5 yr was
approximately zero. A potentially high rate of increase was curtailed by disappearance of juveniles and yearlings; juveniles tended to disperse from the natal burrow. The principal changes following
the reduction were increases in percentage of yearling squirrels breeding and of juveniles remaining on the study area. Litter size and proportion of adult females breeding did not change
significantly, but losses during hibernation, due in part to badger predation, decreased. Dispersal of squirrels from the study area played a key role in population regulation. Dispersers probably
suffered higher mortality than sedentary squirrels, but dispersal was not necessarily maladaptive for the individual. Dispersers may have been unable to produce young at high densities; thus
emigration offered the only opportunity for reproduction.","Slade, Norman A. and Balph, David F."

dominance, and readiness to fight, particularly when accompanied by clawing of the ground, for the latter case. Marking is also performed in neighboring residences, where it frequently involves
fighting and chasing away the intruder. The squirrel also rubs its anogenital area against the substrate. A liquid trail (urine? secretion of the anal glands? both?) is left behind, possibly an
indicator of sex and (or) reproductive condition. The anal gland papillae pulsate during some agonistic encounters.Extensive scent dissemination and scent-sharing take place between group members and

high style design and to special buildings within that-religious and the like. Secondly, the discussion formed part of historical studies, the implication being that in the present context symbols
were no longer relevant to the designer. In the case of these special buildings the importance of symbols has been recognized and well studied. Among them, for example, the Byzantine church seen as
Ikon, the Mosque and its court in Iran as symbol of paradise, the Roman Pantheon as the ideal dome of Heaven, and the medieval cathedral as the celestial city. Wittkower (1962) shows that the
Renaissance church, far from being purely an aesthetic creation, is a ""visible echo of a celestial and universally valid harmony . . . a manmade echo or visage of God's universe"" (p. 8, 23) and is
rooted in Neo-Platonic symbolism. Scully (1962) sees Greek landscapes as symbolizing the quality of the various Gods and the temple as the concrete embodiment of the particular God in the sacred
landscape. Significantly all these studies seem to have one thing in common. In each case we find the definition of a special place which is distinguished from, and separated out of, the generality of
space around it. Like the Greek temple it does not have to be an enclosed spacemerely a place fraught with a special meaning and of a very special kind, a reflection of a world view. In none of these
studies however, is there any attempt to apply the analysis more broadly to all forms of organized space, whether buildings or settlements. Sometimes the discussion is, in fact, explicitly restricted
to churches and public buildings and specifically excludes all utilitarian buildings, all vernacular architecture and even much of high style design (Prak, 1968). Yet there is much evidence, from a
number of fields, which suggests that this is not the case. I have recently tried to show that this is not true of either vernacular or primitive buildings or settlements and tried to make it clear","Rapoport, Amos"

Experiment I revealed that 9 out of 10 dominant mice lost
their dominant positions after castration, and of the 10 sham-operated dominant mice, 9 still remained dominant. Thus, androgen is necessary for the maintenance of social dominance. Experiment II
showed that.2,.4, and.8 mg of testosterone propionate (TP) injected daily to the castrated dominant mice did not restore their precastration dominant positions. Experiment III replicated the second
experiment by giving 5 castrated dominant mice.8 mg of TP and and another 5 mice 1.2 mg of TP. Neither treatment restored the precastration dominant status of the treated mice. The animals were then
injected with 4 mg of TP, which was not effective in restoring their precastration dominance position. The 8 mg of TP used in Experiment IV was also not effective. The relationship between androgen
and social order was discussed.","Lee, C. T. and Naranjo, J. N."

The technique
used links ecological and behavioral data obtained in the field with laboratory data on sperm competition, for which a model has already been developed (Parker, 1970a) . The reproductive behavior can
be summarized as follows (see also Hammer, 1941, and previous papers in this series). Males wait around fresh cattle droppings for gravid females as they arrive to mate and lay their eggs in the dung.
Females can mature several batches of eggs, but visit the dung only for mating and oviposition. Here males outnumber females by over 4: 1 (males spend much more time around the dung) and intra-male
competition for females is intense. Mating may occur on the dropping or in the surrounding grass, and afterwards the male stays paired to the female (in a passive phase; Parker, 1970e) while she
oviposits. Paired males guard females with elaborate reactions, but take-overs can occur in attacks from unpaired males. Here the new male mates immediately, before the female starts or resumes
oviposition. The average number of eggs which will be fertilized by a given male as a result of a mating with a newlyarrived (""incoming"") female can be calculated; so can egg gains due to take-overs
either during mating or oviposition (Parker, 1970a). Evidence has been given (Parker, 1970b)","Parker, G. A."

ascertain whether such a mechanism can be induced in laboratory populations of the freshwater, pulmonate mollusc, Biomphalaria glabrata (Say), kept in a defined medium, under carefully controlled
conditions, either by increasing the number of snails or by decreasing the volume available to each snail. The extent to which changes in these environmental factors receive expression in growth,
natality and mortality rates of the snails was measured. Eisenberg (1966, 1970) has shown that the regulation of natural populations of Limnaea elodes (palustris) Say is achieved mainly by changes in
the first two of these three parameters. The data will be used to construct a model of snail populations, to be tested by comparing predictions with observations in the field, which might eventually
serve to evaluate methods of snail population control (Jobin \& Michelson 1967).","Thomas, J. D. and Benjamin, M."

closed breeding units. Mathematical analyses of linear body measurements show significant differences in morphological features between three demes, not only in averages but also in the inter-
relatedness of body characteristics, suggesting an underlying genetic integrity within demes. Interdemic gene flow through individuals appears to be inconsequential, but there may be significant gene
flow through the formation of temporary TG's.  Altruistic behavior among territorial males may contribute to kinship selection, and the individual kob behavior in response to predation suggests that
altruism may have a bearing on the regulation of predation. The lek system of social organization may be significant in maintaining genetic heterogeneity in the kob antelope, which lives in
geographically isolated populations throughout its range.","Buechner, Helmut K. and Daniel Roth, H."

we can delimit various of these lineage groups: a set of sibs, parents, and their offspring, a close-knit tribe of families related by at least the degree of third cousin, and so on. If selection
operates on any of the groups as a unit, the process is referred to as kin selection. At a higher level, an entire breeding population may be the unit, so that populations (i.e., demes) possessing
different genotypes are diminished or extinguished differentially, in which case we speak of interdemic (or interpopulation) selection. The hierarchy of ascending levels of selection is visualized in
Figure 1. The concept of group selection was introduced by Darwin in ""The Origin of Species"" to account for the evolution of sterile castes in social insects. The term intergroup selection, in the
sense of interdemic selection defined here, was used by Sewall Wright in 1945. Essentially the same expression (Gruppenauslese), was used independently and with the same meaning by Olavi Kalela (1954,
1957), while the phrase kin selection was coined by J. Maynard Smith (1964). The classification adopted here is approximately that recommended by J. L. Brown (1966). Selection can also operate at the
level of species or entire clusters of related species. The process, well known to paleontologists and biogeographers, is responsible for the familiar patterns of dynastic succession of major groups
such as ammonites, sharks, graptolites, and dinosaurs through geologic time (Simpson 1953, P. J. Darlington 1971). It is even possible to conceive of the differential extinction of entire ecosystems,

also conducted in nature and in the aquarium. Most populations consist of a pair of fish,but this is due to territorial restrictions imposed by the size of the sea anemone colony.A.xanthurus is not
biologically monogamous. Both male and female defend territories,but territorial behavior differs between sexes. Male territorial energies focus outward,in defense of the periphery of the
territory,while female territories focus inward on the accessibility of male nesting holes.Female territories may be more than twice as large as male territories and may overlap the nesting holes of
two or more males. Dominance seems to determine the location and size of female territories.Males are more aggressive than females in defense of nest holes against invaders. Reproductive success seems
to be the primary reason for territoriality in both sexes.Males defend nesting sites throughout the year,probably due to restrictions on availability of nesting space dictated by the size of the sea
anemone colony.Immatures and some low ranking adults do not defend territory. Crowding in aquaria results in increased aggression and more obvious dominance patterns.Invariably,females are dominant
over males in the aquarium and display a subtle dominance in natuie. Both bottom organisms and plankton seem to be important food for adult anemonefish. During the breeding season nearly all the
anemonefish in a colony may occasionally rise up above the anemones to feed on swarms of plankton.The frequency of courtship and agonistic displays at such times suggests some sort of social mixing
function.Various crustaceans are a danger to the eggs at night, when nests are unguarded. A.xanthurus is able to tolerate temperatures of 13•‹C or less,and goes into semi-hibernation in winter.Life
expectancy is probably three to four years. On Miyake,Cymbactis actinostoloides and rarely Stoichactis kenti are apparently the only sea anemones with which A.xanthurus has a symbiotic relationship.At
night anemonefish hide deep within the rocks at the base of the anemone or rest in the tentacles of the anemone. Much attention has been focused in recent years on the meaning and possible purposes of
territorial defense and aggression in vertebrates (Lorenz,1966;Nice,1941;Burt,1943;WynneEdwards,1962).Among the fishes it is not surprising that the pomacentrids have attracted interest in this
respect,due to their extremely aggressive character and easily observable territoriality(Clarke,1970;Limbaugh,1964;Myrberg,et al.,1967;Turner and Ebert,1962). However,comparatively little attention
has been given to territory and aggression as such among the anemonefish,with far more interest being directed toward their symbiotic relationship with various species of sea anemones. It is our
purpose in this paper to record our observations on the life history of the anemonefish,Amphiprion xanthurus Cuvier,with particular emphasis being placed on the problem of territory and aggression.
Materials and methods Observations were begun on a limited scale while free diving in the summer of 1969.In 1970 our studies intensified and continued throughout 1971 and 1972,with the addition of

implicity, in antiquity. During the 17th century, with an increased knowledge of natural history, the idea became a functional assumption, but within a theological rather than ecological context. In
the 18th century Linnaeus defined the concept and attempted to make it the foundation of an ecological science. However, it remained tied to theology and was elaborated without critical examination.
The existence of agricultural pests, the occasional occurrence of plagues of animals, and the possibility of species having become extinct were kinds of evidence which would have been difficult to
reconcile with contemporary concepts. Lamarck was one of the few who perceived some anomaly, and he attempted to save the old concept by arguing that fossils represented early forms of existing
species rather than extinct species. His ideas were not widely accepted. Wallace found fault with the Linnaean concept, but it was only a passing thought which he never published. Darwin attempted to
assimilate the balanced-of-nature concept into his description of natural selection, but without exploring the inconsistencies between the Linnacean concept and his theory. As other naturalists
shifted their interpretations of nature from static to evolving, few of them appreciated the need to change their understanding of the balance of nature accordingly. Some naturalists and ecologists
who have thought seriously about balance of nature have postulated somewhat mystical supraorganismic concepts. These, like the general concepts, arose in antiquity, but unlike the general concepts
they have won only limited acceptance. Balance-of-nature concepts apparently have receded in importance with the rise of ecological specialization, probably because ecologists have developed more
precise concepts of productivity and ecosystem can serve about the same explanatory functions.","Egerton, Frank N."

Differences presumably arise from some degree of isolation by ecological barriers, or
mere distance, with natural selection favoring different genotypes in different areas. Isolation is assumed to be prerequisite for selection to produce statistically demonstrable genetic
differentiation. In contrast, genetic uniformity is taken to indicate free gene flow among localities, or the existence of some form of balancing selection (Prakash et al., 1969). The existence of
genetic differences among relatively restricted areas of prolific marine organisms with planktonic dispersal stages (Frydenberg et al., 1965; M0ller, 1968, 1969; Koehn et al., 1973) has led us to
question this kind of reasoning. In the cod, for instance, passive dispersal of the planktonic eggs and larvae by ocean currents should last for weeks or months, notably in colder parts of its range.
Ocean current velocities are such that dispersal for hundreds of kilometers should be common. However, expected genetic uniformity over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers is not supported by
observation. There are consistent differences in the hemoglobin allele frequencies along the Norwegian coast (Frydenberg et al., 1965) as well as between inshore and offshore samples (M0ller, 1969).
There are additionally, significant differences with respect to depth of the samples in both hemoglobin and blood type allele frequencies (M0ller, 1968). Microgeographically, similar observations can
be made, such as the significant differences at the tetrazolium oxidase locus in the marine pelecypod Modiolus demissus between high and low areas of the tidal zone (Koehn et al., 1973). We here
suggest that isolation is not prerequisite to the above described genetic differentiation, but that every locality derives its adult stock from the same zygote pool. Given selection of sufficient
intensity, striking genetic differences can be produced between the sedentary adult stocks that are widely dispersed as young and belong to the same panmictic population. Also, recent literature that
isoenzyme variation is responsive to local environmental conditions (Koehn and Rasmussen, 1967; O'Gower and Nicol, 1968; Johnson et al., 1969; Koehn, 1969; Prakash et al., 1969; Richmond, 1970;
Marshall and Allard, 1970; Koehn et al., 1971; Smith and Koehn, 1971; Koehn and Mitton, 1972; Merritt, 1972) suggests that genetic isolation is not prerequisite for differing genetic composition
throughout the range of the species. While most marine organisms with pelagic larvae breed in various geographic areas, and therefore do not offer a simple situation in which the relative importance
of selection and isolation can be estimated, in the American eel, Anguilla rostrata, all divergence between localities must necessarily arise in the absence of isolation. The thorough investigations
of Schmidt (1922, 1925) indicate that all spawning by the American eel takes place in a circumscribed region northeast of the West Indies. O'cean currents disperse the leptocephalus larvae to American
shores from northern South America to the Arctic. The leptocephali in coastal waters metamorphose into elvers that move into estuarine or fresh waters, where they grow to adult size. These resi-","Williams, George C. and Koehn, Richard K. and Mitton, Jeffry B."

techniques in the field. The seasonal rhythms of advertising song in the populations over three years were found to be species-specific, and were related to male arrival, female arrival and pairing.
Population song was also related to population breeding acivity as revealed by the seasonal pattern of egg-laying. When population song was more synchronised, population breeding activiy was more
synchronised towards the start of the breeding season. The diurnal rhythms of advertising song in individual marked males were monitored before and after pairing. In Sedge Warbler males advertising
song ceased completely after pairing, and only resumed if the female deserted. In Reed Warbler males, a vestige of the former diurnal rhythm remained after pairing, with groups of paired males
performing dawn and dusk choruses of 'social song'. The interspecific differences were extended further, as both observations and play-back experiments confirmed that paired male Sedge Warblers did
not utilise advertising song in territorial interactions, but performed visual 'threat' displays instead. Male Reed Warblers however utilised advertising song in territorial interactions both before
and after pairing. A functional interpretation of advertising song is presented, based upon the observational and experimental evidence collected. It is suggested that the prime function of persistent
advertising song in the unpaired male is sexual attraction of the female, and that intermittent advertising song from paired males functions in territorial defence. The precise function(s) of social
song in paired males are not known, but some suggestions are discussed. The interspecific differences in the functional spectra of advertising song found in the Reed Warbler (sexual, territorial,
social) and Sedge Warbler (sexual only,) are discussed in relation to habitat and social organisation. The Reed Warbler inhabits more dense, non-visual habitats, and the Sedge Warbler more open,
visual ones. Thus the Sedge Warbler has developed comparatively more visual forms of advertisement, and the Reed Warbler more vocal forms which in the latter case is reflected particularly in the
wider functional spectrum of advertising song. The only common function for which advertising song is utilised in both species is sexual attraction of the female. This, and other evidence discussed
suggests that sexual attraction may be the most important and perhaps the most primitive function of advertising song in these species.","Catchpole, Clive K."

The seasonal
occupation of the colony from January to November is described, together with the patterns of site occupation, nest-building, egg laying, incubation and brooding behaviour. Pair members share almost
equally the duties of incubation and the brooding and feeding of the young. Although one partner can compensate considerably for the absence of its mate, both sexes must normally contribute for
breeding to be successful. A high peak of activity prior to laying probably brings the female into ovulatory condition, and strengthens the pair bond just before shared incubation places the greatest
strain upon it. These effects are probably mediated through arrival displays on the site. Comparisons revealed that established pairs and older, more experienced breeding individuals showed higher
levels of activity and attendance than less experienced birds. The former also integrated their patterns of behaviour more effectively, and this probably contributes to their greater reproductive
success. Naive individuals showed a marked improvement in their breeding activity during their second year together. However some inexperienced breeding individuals integrate their activities very
successfully at their first attempt, whereas some experienced individuals do not. It is suggested that some measure of compatibility may be necessary for successful co-ordination of breeding
activities between pad members. This idea of compatibility is consistent with the very considerable degree of heterogeneity in the patterns of pair behaviour recorded within the population, although
established pairs showed very similar patterns in successive years.","Wooller, R."

conditioning and the variability of the intertrial interval. New research is reported which directly examines the effects of these two variables and supports the importance of immobilizing the
subject, but not of varying the intertrial interval during conditioning. It is suggested that vocal behavior in the rat may be conditioned only when no competing species-specific defense reaction
(e.g., freezing) is available to the subject. The first attempt to condition shockelicited vocalization in rats was reported in 1932. During the ensuing 40 years, reports have appeared indicating that
rat vocal behavior is both easily conditioned and impossible to condition. The present paper attempts to reconcile some of these contradictory results by reference to key procedural differences in
these studies. In uncovering which variables are crucial to the vocal conditioning process, it is hoped that a more comprehensive view of vocal behavior in the rat will emerge. Warner (1932) reported
sporadic instances of what looked like conditioned vocalizations to shock in one rat. Following this lead, Schlosberg (1934) exposed rats to signal-shock pairings in a Pavlovian conditioning procedure
with light or buzzer serving as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and shock as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Variable intertrial intervals (ITIs) regulated stimulus presentations, and all subjects were

mcleannani) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, showed that they persistently follow army ants for arthropods flushed by the ants. Dominant over the smaller antbirds that follow ants, they take the best
zone low over the center of an ant swarm and drop to the ground for prey. They rest and preen for long periods of maintenance behavior each day, probably because as dominant birds they get food
easily. Alarm behavior is similar to that of other antbirds. Agonistic behavior contrasts with other antbirds in having a silent challenging display and an unusually wide spectrum of submissive calls
and postures. Courtship is mainly courtship feeding and singing; monogamous mates stay together for years. The nest is probably sunk in the ground between tree buttresses. Males incubate in the
morning and late afternoon, females in the early afternoon and at night. Males and females feed nestlings and fledglings. Pairs renest repeatedly during the rainy season, April to December, but nest
predation is high. Young are feeding themselves a month after appearing at swarms with their parents, but then irregularly stay with their parents up to several months (females) or years (males).
Loose patrilineal clans form, in which gene transfer between clans is mainly by movement of young females. Daughters-in-law are tolerated. Clan members sometimes forage together, but use much
submissive display. They close ranks or ""bunch"" in disputes with other pairs or clans. The social system is somewhat like that of chimpanzee groups and perhaps like that of early man— two other
dominant animals dependent on local and varying sources of food. The clan system permits complete overlap of home ranges of pairs. The parental pair in an area tends to dominate trespassing pairs and
their own offspring. This social system permits great local concentration over good ant swarms. It is facilitated by tolerance for related birds, silent (and thus less disturbing) challenging, and by
a wide variety of submissive displays. The Ocellated Antbirds on Barro Colorado concentrated at ant swarms on escarpment zones near the center of the island. Even with these concentrations, however,
the species declined to near extirpation between 1960 and 1971. OFFICIAL PUBLICATION DATE is handstamped in a limited number of initial copies and is recorded in the Institution's annual report,

concluded that hunting-gathering peoples were regulated more by mortality than by fertility factors. These 2 forces were of about equal weight among urbanized agricultural populations before the
industrial revolution. Since then the industrial revolution fertility factors have predominated. Much of the decline in mortality resulted from improved living conditions and sanitation since medical

considerably from England and Wales and from one another in such important respects as the period and rate of population growth, the levels of birth rate and death rate and the timing of agricultural

Since man, the dominant life form in the
ecosystem, adapts primarily through culture, his culture must include, as part of its adaptive scheme, a subsystem to control population growth. A systemic model of population control is presented
involving female infanticide which regulates the excess females and produces a shortage of adult women. Because of their scarcity, conflicts over women are the cause of most primitive warfare through
which the excess males are regulated. This model is tested cross‐culturally on a sample of ninety‐nine populations representing thirty‐seven contemporary hunter‐gatherer societies by demonstrating the

philosophers have taken a more dour view, however. Writing in the cut-throat atmosphere of Renaissance Italy, Machiavelli argued that: \&dquo;All those who have written upon civil institutions

Although the two species
are closely related P. r. shenandoah grows to a longer body length and has a broader head. All ages classes of P. r. shenandoah emigrate out of the talus and are found within 3 m of the talus edge,
but only adults which are as large as or larger than the largest P. cinereus are able to survive farther than about 3 m from the talus. This distribution is not explained by a tendency for large
adults to wander more than juveniles. The large P. r. shenandoah in the soil take prey that are significantly larger than prey taken by conhabiting P. cinerueus, indicating that food may be the
limited resource for which competition occurs. Both species are euryphagic and prey upon the same taxa of small animals. Food is periodically limited in availability, but not in abundance. Following a
rain, salamanders forage freely and consume a large quantity of prey, based on stomach contents, but prey become increasingly unavailable as the soil and leaf litter dry and the salamanders are
restricted to isolated pockets of moisture. Stomachs remain virtually empty until the next rain, at which time they are full again indicating that the abundance of prey is not greatly affected by the
intervening dryness. Food may periodically become a limited resource during long dry seasons and as such may affect the survival of the salamanders or their ability to produce eggs. It is not clear
whether interspecific competition is through differential exploitation of the limited resource or through interference. Lack of evidence for interspecific aggression may indicate that the former
occurs, although it could not be demonstrated experimentally. Contiguous allopatry between the two species seems to result from an interaction of competitive exclusion and differential tolerance to
dryness; P. cinereus is presumably a superior competitor for food in the soil and excludes P. r. shenandoah to areas of talus which P. cinereus cannot enter due to its tolerance of drier conditions in
the rocks.","Jaeger, Robert G."
22,somit_review_1972,Review {Article}: {Biopolitics},1972-01-01,"The idea that biological concepts are helpful in explaining political phenomena, and that biological factors play a significant role in political behavior, has a long history in Western political
thought. In one version, the state is portrayed as a living organism with the various parts of the state (or government) functioning much as do the parts of the body, i.e., head, heart, arms, etc.
Alternatively, when attention turns to the external rather than the internal life of states, the resulting relationships are treated as the inevitable outcome of the 'struggle for survival' to which
all living organisms are presumably condemned. In both cases, the language employed is rich in biologic metaphor lebensraum, birth, death, growth, decay, youth, age, sickness and health. Another
biologically-oriented approach treats 'human nature' as a limiting, as well as an explanatory, factor in political life. Here we need only recall that distinguished school of political philosophy
which holds that the behavior of political man springs from 'human nature' and that selfishness, avarice and ingratitude are among the more outstanding, if unlovely, attributes of that nature. This
line of thought can be traced from Greek speculation through eighteenthcentury conservatism and, appropriately restated, contributed to, and drew sustenance from nineteenth-century Social Darwinism.
Social Darwinism, and especially the tenet that social behavior was in significant measure the product of man's biological make-up, soon became intellectually disreputable. While there were many
reasons for this, not all of them scientific, the fact remains that, by the early 1900s, the theory that human nature could more satisfactorily be understood in terms of learned responses was gaining
ascendancy; by the thirties, it was the accepted wisdom. With few exceptions, social scientists trained after the First World War simply took it for granted that they could safely ignore man's genetic

even more surely the case among precocial than among altricial birds, and it is nowhere less adequately explained than in the Charadrii (waders or shorebirds). As Boyd (1962) has shown, a study of
clutch size as a measure of fertility or reproductive rate ""is unrewarding in the case of waders, in which most Palaearctic species have a modal clutch of four."" Boyd's study shows, for example, that
in four species of Charadrius the annual egg production per female varies from 3.0 to 6.3, yet the annual recruitment of individuals into the population remains much the same for each species. The
present paper sets out the data concerning variations in clutch size among the Charadrii from a phylogenetic viewpoint rather than one of adaptive significance. I do not wish to imply that clutch size
has no adaptive significance, but I hope to show that clutch size in the Charadrii has some real phylogenetic significance when used in conjunction with other characters of known phylogenetic use. The
theory of clutch size that I shall try to substantiate depends upon the assumption that the ancestral clutch in the waders is 4 eggs. From the following review I shall draw certain conclusions about

Indices of coyote populations in
the spring, summer, and fall of the same years, and in the winter of 1963 to 1966, collectively, provided trend information for the period 1963 to 1970. An estimate of the percentage of female coyotes
breeding in 1969 was obtained from a February collection of 19 carcasses in a region surrounding the study area. Estimates of litter sizes and percentages of females breeding in the western third of
Utah were obtained from records of the Division of Wildlife Services. Coyote food habits were studied from stomach contents of 186 animals collected in the winters of 1967-68, 196S69, and 1969-70; and
from 111 scats collected year-round, 196S69. Coyotes in the study area from 196S70 may have numbered somewhere near 200 or more animals in the S years of study. The population declined from its
highest index value in 1963 to one-seventh of that value in 1968, then increased substantially in 1969 and 1970. These changes appear to have been correlated with the density of black-tailed
jackrabbits (Lepus califorricus ) the previous year. The causal mechanism may in part have been the effect of jackrabbit density ( jackrabbits comprised three-fourths or more of the coyote diet during
the period of study) on the coyote reproductive rate, both in terms of litter size and percentage of females breeding. Although most of the observed coyote mortality was man-induced, it represented
only a part of the total; hence, the pattern and causes of mortality remain largely unknown. Long-range coyote density appears to be partly a function of the size of the food base, with artificial

density. The physiological or behavioral links, or both, are unknown at present. This paper summarizes part of the findings of a long-term study of coyote populations being conducted on a 700-square-
mile study area in northwestern Utah and southcentral Idaho. Coyotes in this area have fluctuated markedly from 1963 to 1970, the period for which we have data. The purpose of this paper is to explore
the circumstances of these changes and their possible interactions with population changes of black-tailed jackrabbits. The study was conducted in the eastern edge of the Great Basin where jackrabbits
are a prominent herbivore, historically subject to marked population changes (Palmer 1897, Nelson","Clark, Frank W."

concealing coloration serves the same purpose (Ford, 1957, 1964). Other factors promoting discontinuous diversity, usually leading to a balanced polymorphism, are the maintenance of a normal sex
ratio, heterozygous advantage, relative abundance of morphs in relation to learning behavior of vertebrate predators, and differential mating preferences (Ford, 1965). Negative assortative mating is
one of several systems that could maintain in addition a high level of heterozygosity within a population without the heterozygote necessarily being superior in fitness to either homozygote. However,
preference for mating with unlike partners has only rarely been encountered in nature. Disassortative mating is reported between morphs of the adult tiger moth, Panaxia dominula (Sheppard, 1952,
1953), between certain mutant lines of Drosophila melanogaster (Rendel, 1951), and in wild populations of the polymorphic whitethroated sparrow, Zonotrichia albicollis (Lowther, 1961; Thorneycroft,
1966). Frequency-dependent disassortative mating has also been discovered in laboratory colonies of six Drosophila species (see Ehrman, 1969 for review). All of these reported situations involve a
positive contribution of this type of mate selection to the maintenance of a balanced polymorphism in the population. The present paper reports a situation in a polymorphic species where assortative
and disassortative mating both work against the maintenance of a balanced (stable) polymorphism. The neotropical nymphalid butterfly Anartia fatima Fabricius shows a striking color dimorphism in the
adult. This study presents data that indicate the polymorphism is balanced, and offers evidence that both negative and positive assortative mating contribute significantly in a negative way against
the maintenance of the two phenotypes in natural populations in Costa Rica. Selective forces are outlined that may contribute to counterbalancing this negative effect of mate selection. These two sets
of opposing selective pressures influence the frequencies of the forms at different altitudes, geographic localities, and seasons in this neotropical area.","Emmel, Thomas C."

Puffin burrow density was negatively correlated with distance from the cliff edge and
positively correlated with angle of slope. These correlations are biologically significant in that close to the cliff edge, where the angle of slope was steep, breeding success was significantly
higher than on adjacent level habitat. In spring both habitats were occupied simultaneously, and nest—site tenacity was equally strong in them. During settlement the frequency of fighting was higher
and the peak was reached earlier on slope habitat. Males were heavier on slope than on level habitat just after peak egg laying, although wing lengths were similar. Females were similar on the two
habitats. Measurements of eggs from both habitat were the same. Egg—laying dates were also similar, but annual variation was greater on level than on slope habitat, as was variation within a single
year. Hatching success was higher on slope habitat, mainly because the incidence of egg disappearance was lower during incubation; also the frequency of infertile eggs was greater on level habitat.
Fledging success was higher on slope habitat, and higher on both habitats in 1969. Frequency of chick deaths in the nest and disappearance before fledging was higher on level habitat in both years.
Fledging success was higher for early—hatched chicks in both habitats. Total breeding success was higher on slope habitat, and higher in both habitats in 1969. Fledging condition of chicks varied
according to the habitat and time period in which they were raised. On the average, body weight at fledging was greater and less variable for birds on slope habitat; early—hatched chicks were heaviest
in both habitats. Wing length of young at fledging did not differ. Early—hatched chicks on slope habitat fledged quickest (also quicker than early—hatched chicks on level habitat); late—hatched birds
on slope fledged slower than late—hatched birds on level habitat. Age at fledging was greater in 1968 than in 1969 on both habitats. Meal size delivered to chicks by parents was the same on the two
habitats, but frequency of feeding was greater on slope than level habitat. Breeding pairs on slope habitat were unable to raise two chicks (artificial twins) to fledging; similarly, one adult could
not rear a single chick. Adults feeding chicks on level habitat were attacked and robbed more frequently by gulls than birds on slope habitat, probably because escape (take—off) from an attack was
quicker on slope than on level ground. Experiments performed to determine causes of the differential egg and chick loss before fledging in the two habitats showed that during incubation the proportion
of eggs displaced to the burrow entrance by incubating birds when leaving the burrow in a hurry was the same, but the rate of panic flights was higher on level habitat. Also, chicks when starved spent
more time at the burrow entrance than when fed regularly. It is concluded that the difference in breeding success on the two habitats was due to a higher exposure of eggs and chicks to gull predation
on level habitat. The primary cause for this differential exposure was that adults on slope habitat were less vulnerable to gull disturbance during incubation and gull robbery when feeding their
chicks. Thus breeding failures resulted from the interactions of food shortage and gull interference. This conclusion was tested by comparing breeding performance of birds at Great Island with birds
at two islands where gull interference was absent. Egg and chick survival was greater under ""gull—free"" conditions. In addition, body weights at fledging were higher and less variable at the colonies
without gull interference than at Great Island. The ways in which natural selection acts upon puffins at the breeding colony are considered; a model relating puffin nest distribution and habitat
features is presented, and predictions which might be tested are outlined.","Nettleship, David N."

determinant and of positive altruism in tri-determinant systems. Peck orders, territorial systems, and an ant society are analyzed as examples. In all models, evolution is primarily by individual
selection, probably supplemented by group selection. Group selection is differential extinction of populations. It can act only on populations preformed by selection at the individual level, but can
either cancel individual selective trends (effecting evolutionary homeostasis) or supplement them; its supplementary effect is probably increasingly important in the evolution of increasingly

can be related to social aspects of the population. It can be used to compare any two populations, and for this purpose it has advantages over traditional comparative statistics such as life
expectancy, which consider only mortality. By selecting life tables representing general stages of human cultural evolu- tion, it has been shown that hunting-gathering populations were regulated more
by mortality than by fertility factors. That is, more growth which could have occurred did not occur due to the incidence of mortality than to the incidence of infecundity. The two forces were of

increasing our knowledge about the larger land mammals by the acquisition of new information on their migratory movements, social behavior, bioenergetics, and physiological processes such as
thermoregulation and water balance. The perfection of satellite tracking and monitoring systems specifically designed for wild animals, such as caribou and elephants, in remote areas of the Earth is
feasible; and such systems hold considerable promise in providing access to information that has been exceptionally difficult to obtain in the past. Challenges in the development of practical
radiotelemetry systems include: light-weight, long-lasting sources of power; developing systems that require little power; increasing the variety of implantable physiological sensors; improving the
resolution of locations (to 100 m or less) for tracking an animal by satellite; improvement of antennas for greater efficiency in transmissions without interfering with the animal’s activities; and
interfacing implanted sensor-transmitters with long-range transmitters on the animal’s surface. The perfection of systems for attachment of instrument packages to polar bears, elephants, and other
wild animals is also demanding.","Buechner, H. K."

reduction in body weight. Since smaller moths lay few eggs4, both these effects would contribute to the density-dependent regulation of numbers in succeeding generations. I describe here a mechanism
which could bring about these effects. I suggest that last-instar larvae of A. kuehniella, when they meet, deposit on the substratum drops of secretion from their mandibular glands; and that the
response of other last-instar larvae to this secretion results not only in the regulation of the total numbers of A. kuehniella in a finite system (as studied by Smith3), but also in the control of

The bases of the model are measures of fertility and survival of adult females and their offspring, respectively, as
functions of increasing harem size. Our data indicate that an adult female makes her greatest contribution to the next generation (is most fit) when she is monogamous. A second curve describing the
fitness of the harem master with increasing harem size indicates that he is maximally fit when he maintains a harem of two or three females. Consideration of the optimal mating system for each sex
leads to predictions concerning the types of behavior that would allow each sex to realize its optimal mating system. Females should react aggressively toward other females and solicit the attentions
of the male. The aggressive behavior of the female should be linked with her reproductive state. Pregnant females will be more aggressive than nonpregnant females. The male, on the other hand, should
actively recruit females and act to pacify interactions between females. These expectations are realized in marmots and a number of avian species. The reproductive success of females in the Gothic
area is affected by the availability of food during gestation. When the growing season is early, more young are produced. In those years, however, the mean harem size is smaller, apparently due to
increased aggression among adult females. The different reproductive strategies of males and females, and the influence of food availability on those strategies, lead to the prediction that bigamous
matings should be the commonest mating type. This prediction is verified by our field data. It should be noted that bigamy is disadvantageous, relatively, to both males and females. A general
formulation of optimal harem size based on the fitness of a male and the females in his harem is given. Large harems are expected to be variable and aggression among females should be reduced.
Observations on pinnipeds support these predictions. Small harems would appear to be more stable. Consequently, behavior that would lead to pair formation and maintenance are expected. Pair-bonding in
monogamous species of birds is in keeping with this prediction. When the optimal harem size is small, transient perturbations have effects opposite to those expected on a long-term basis. The effect
of food abundance on marmots at Gothic is a decrease in mean harem size.","Downhower, Jerry F. and Armitage, Kenneth B."

replacements that run from large to small areas and from more to less favorable climates. This pattern coincides broadly with a world-wide pattern of species numbers. Evolution by group selection,
proceeding most rapidly and effectively where species are most numerous, connects the patterns and can supply the force that gives direction to the dispersal pattern. Directional change at any level
of complexity involves movement that results in the formation of diverse groups of units (which are themselves groups of smaller units) and differential survival . This process—generalized group
selection—has been continuous from chemical evolution on the earth's surface, through the origin of life, and into successive interacting levels of organic evolution. A corollary is that evolution
should make situations favorable to itself, by group selection, and has probably done so in (for example) tropical rain forest, where new information about group evolution may be sought.","Darlington, Philip J."

on both questions, and to place the action of enemies, both endemic and introduced ones, as discussed at length in other chapters of this book, in perspective relative to natural control as a general
phenomenon. We first deal with the concept of natural control itself, with the classification of the components of the process, with the two principal theories or viewpoints, with the various
expressions of the density-related mechanism, and lastly, with the role of natural enemies, (a) in the process of regulation, (b) in control as distinct from regulation, and (c) with the damping
processes either inherent or extrinsic to enemy action but required as supplemental feature(s) in maintaining stability. The role of natural enemies is also discussed relative to recent challenges and
indictments of the supposed theory and practices of biological control practitioners.","Huffaker, C. B. and Messenger, P. S. and DeBach, Paul"

anthropomorphism. “Scarcely had ethologists finished shaking their fingers at sentimentalists who spoke of animals as though they were men,” writes one critic, “when they themselves set to work to
prove that men were animals. Zoomorphism became rife.” [2] And zoomorphologists tend to cast a bleak eye on man; whenever humans are shown to differ from animals, the results are viewed as
ecologically deplorable. Thus man, unlike animals, has no built-in mechanism to prevent his population from rising to the level of starvation, as Wynne-Edwards has just reminded us; and man’s
degradation of the environment is not corrigible by ordinary ecological constraints.","Lowenthal, D. and Calhoun, J. B. and Craik, K. H. and Fitch, J. M. and Olin, U. and Studer, R. G."

Ecologists are becoming increasingly aware that changes in social behavior and population numbers are often associated, and that food shortage, predation, disease and bad weather are often not
sufficient to give a full explanation of changes in numbers. Some workers consider that changes in food supply are needed to cause fluctuations in numbers, but others that they are not necessary. One
of the difficulties is that food quality in biochemical or nutrient terms, as distinct from mere quantity of material, has been greatly neglected in ecology, despite its well-established importance
for the survival, weight, physiology, reproduction and behavior of domestic animals and man. Furthermore, the different views of Andrewartha \& Birch (1), Wynne-Edwards (20), Lack (6) and Chitty (3),
show that theoretical views on the mechanics of population control are widely different. Anyone surveying the literature will rapidly conclude that remarkably few studies have been done on the inter-
relationships between behavior, population, and food or other features in the environment. There are plenty of studies on any one of these aspects, and quite a number on population-food relations, but
few on population-behavior relations, very few on food-behavior relations, and hardly any on all three aspects together.","Watson, Adam and Moss, Robert"

advantage of social roosting cannot be explained only in terms of protection from predators, shelter for adverse weather and/or conservation of energy at night. Data are presented in support of the
claim that in A. ibis an important, if not the main, function of communal roosting is in assisting individuals to maintain contact with each other. The value of this behaviour rests in more efficient
finding and exploitation of localized food resources. It is suggested that the gregarious roosting of A. ibis has been evolved primarily in relation to the food situation, and that communal roosting

The criterion
variables were duration of utterance, verbal quantity, eye contact, and verbal velocity. Using a mixed factorial analysis of variance design, each of 36 students was assigned to one of three stress
levels and to one of three interviewers. Every subject was then interviewed in every possible combination of three room sizes and three interpersonal distances. It was found that very close distance
depressed the duration of utterance and number of words uttered but left verbal velocity relatively unchanged. No difference was found in these measures as a function of either room size, interviewer
or stress as induced in accord with the design. Eye contact was found to be significantly less in a large room (280 square feet) than in the two smaller rooms (144 and 64 square feet). This measure,
eye contact, was also depressed by close interpersonal distance. It rose progressively at the greater distances of the design. This latter finding was in accord with previous studies. There were no
significant interactive effects of the various experimental factors with the exception of the following: an experimenter by distance effect and an experimenter by distance by stress effect. The study
concludes that interviewee speech and visual behavior is significantly affected by size of room and interpersonal distance. TABLE OF CONTENTS vi ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS . ABSTRACT LIST OF TABLES . . LIST OF

46,kummer_spacing_1970,Spacing mechanisms in social behavior,1970-01-01,"Social relations and spatial arrangement of animals are connected in many ways. Societies, for example, use space as the safest technique of regulating social interactions. Incompatible individuals
can live tolerably at a great distance from each other. On the other hand, evolution makes individuals incompatible when a great distance between them is desirable for other than social reasons.
Ecological pressures thus can realize certain advantageous spatial arrangements in a population by means of social afhnities and antagonisms (Wynne-Edwards, 1962). In general, social affinity and
spatial proximity are so highly correlated that the distribution of animals in space can be used as a first reading of their social structure. An ideal aerial photograph of a population would show
whether its members adhere to a solitary life, whether they live in pairs, or in large groups. Even within the group, afhnities are revealed by spatial arrangements (Carpenter, 1964; McBride, James

generalized statements regarding the physiographic, vegetational, climatic or kindred zones of which they form a (not necessarily typical) part. The difficulty that is encountered by attempts to
harmonize the findings of the various specialists who nowadays contribute to archaeological studies may, in fact, be due to the limitations of a zonal approach, for the populations or phenomena with

of a species react to each other, and it has important effects on the population dynamics, popula­ tion genetics, and evolution of species. The dispersion of animals in space and time results, in a
proximate sense, from the direct response of individu­ als to features of the environment and to the presence or absence of other individuals of the species. This review will examine concepts of
spacing patterns in mobile animals from the perspective of their proximate causes, their ecological consequences, and their adaptive significance.","Brown, Jerram L. and Orians, Gordon H."
1169,lewontin_units_1970,The {Units} of {Selection},1970-01-01,"The principle of natural selection as the motive force for evolution was framed by Darwin in terms of a ""struggle for existence"" on the part of organisms living in a finite and risky environment. The
logical skeleton of his argument, however, turns out to be a powerful predictive system for changes at all levels of biological organization. As seen by present-day evo­ lutionists, Darwin's scheme
embodies three principles (Lewontin 1) : 1. Different individuals in a popUlation have different morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors (phenotypic variation). 2. Different phenotypes have
different rates of survival and reproduc­ tion in different environments (differential fitness). 3. There is a correlation between parents and offspring in the contribu­ tion of each to future
generations (fitness is heritable). These three principles embody the principle of evolution by natural selec­ tion. While they hold, a population will undergo evolutionary change. It is important to
note a certain generality in the principles. No particular mechanism of inheritance is specifi'ed, but only a correlation in fitness between parent and offspring. The population would evolve whether
the correlation between parent and offspring arose from Mendelian, cytoplasmic, or cultural inheritance. Conversely, when a population is at equilibrium under selection (for example, a stable
polymorphism due to heterozygous superiority), there is no correlation in fitness between parent and offspring, no matter what the mechanism of inheritance. Nor does Principle 2 specify the reason for
the differential rate of contribution to future generations of the different phenotypes. It is not necessary, for example, that resources be in short supply for organisms to struggle for existence.
Darwin himself pointed out that ""a plant at the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought."" Thus, although Darwin came to the idea of natural selection from consideration of
Malthus', essay on overpopulation, the element of competition between organisms for a resource in short supply is not integral to the argument. Natural selection occurs even when two bacterial strains
are growing logarithmically in an excess of nutrient broth if they have different division times. The generality of the principles of natural selection means that any enti­ ties in nature that have
variation, reproduction, and heritability may evolve. For example, if we replace the term individual with the term population and","Lewontin, R. C."
5,stephan_concept_1970,The {Concept} of {Community} in {Human} {Ecology},1970-01-01,"Anyone concerned about the present ecological crisis would be hard pressed to find much literature on the subject contributed by sociologists. Reviews of the literature on air pollution, for example
that by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1968), reflect a good deal of work on the physical and chemical properties of pollutants, on their bio-medical effects, and on the
engineering problems of emission control. To a lesser extent, one also finds literature dealing with the economic, political, administrative, and legal aspects of air pollution. The few studies
contributed by sociologists consist almost exclusively of ""attitude"" or ""awareness"" studies-i.e., socialpsychological studies, the content of which happens to involve ecological phenomena. The same
can be said with respect to the problem of water pollution (U. S. Department of Interior, 1969:57-58). Another aspect of the ecological crisis, the relation between population and food resources, has
received attention by demographers; but even here ecologically oriented contributions seem to come primarily from other specialties (cf. Borgstrom, 1967; Cook, 1962; Paddock \& Paddock, 1967; U.S.
Congress, 1965-1968). In view of the fact that the acquisition of food and the elimination of wastes constitute essential ecological problems, and in view of the fact that sociology has claimed a
subject matter in human ecology for some fifty years or more (Schnore, 1958:620), it seems surprising to me that we have contributed so little to an understanding of these problems. I believe
sociology's lack of attention to such basic ecological problems stems largely from the fact that sociologists have seldom identified them as important problems to begin with. Problems involving the
acquisition of food, the elimination of waste products, the survival of a species-de rigeur for the general, or biological, ecologisthave been regarded as ""sub-social"" by human ecologists (Hawley,
1968:329), as mere ""extension to human beings of plant and animal ecology"" (Quinn, 1940:192). We tend to avoid ""overly biological"" viewpoints in our discipline, perhaps because we fear the charge of
""biological reductionism"" (Schnore, 1958:624-625) or perhaps because we know our own limitations as bioecologists (Duncan, 1959:684). We avoid such viewpoints in spite of the fact that ""man, like
every other living creature, is inextricably involved in the web of life"" (Hawley, 1950:55) and that ""as a living organism, man is affected by climate, food, and disease germs, and he in turn changes
the environment both by utilizing resources and discharging wastes"" (Quinn, 1950-23). The purpose of the present paper is to review the way in which contemporary sociologists delimit he field of human
ecology and to suggest an alternative way of looking at the field. The approach to be offered, it will be argued, is preferable in several respects to those which currently hold sway.","Stephan, G. Edward"

oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus L.). Since 1963, continuous and detailed observations have been made on the Skokholm oystercatcher population and the normal situation is well documented (Harris
1967; Safriel 1967; Harris, Safriel \& Britton unpublished). The population has remained stable, at about forty to fifty pairs, for many years and in the period 1963-68 varied only between forty-nine
and fifty-two pairs. The population on the neighbouring island of Skomer, with which there is an interchange of young birds but not of adults, has similarly remained stable, at between fifty-eight and
seventy-three pairs in the period 1963-69. As well as these breeders there are always nonbreeders in territories and in a roost on the shores of the only permanent pond. Breeding oystercatchers are
extremely territorial, and, with the population already well documented and colour-ringed, it was possible to test by experimental removal of birds whether the constancy in the breeding pairs was due
(a) to the recruitment of young birds balancing out the normal between-season losses of breeders, or (b) to the territorial behaviour of the breeders excluding some sexually mature birds from breeding
(as would seem likely in view of the flock of non-breeders and the constancy of breeding numbers).","Harris, M. P."

relatively constant losses among adults over the winter (Zwickel and Bendell 1967). Despite fluctuating production, constant recruitment of young birds has equalled constant mortality among old birds,
resulting in stable breeding populations. We do not know the mechanism which allows certain young birds to join the breeding population while the rest disappear. I studied the dispersion, movements,
and behavior of Blue Grouse on the summer range to see if there was any evidence of social interaction that might affect recruitment. I concentrated on year-old birds because these are the new

some general properties but in its present form it is applicable only to pinnipeds. Patterns of polygyny are too diverse to have a single evolutionary explanation. For example, sexual dimorphism is
central to our pinniped model, but it has been apparent for many years (Huxley, 1938) that the functional role of sexual dimorphism varies markedly between different taxa.","Bartholomew, George A."

product of works involved chiefly with anatomy and taxonomy. The result is that, in the absence of facts, hypotheses are formed to cover portions of the life histories of nudibranchs about which
little is known. The problematical migrations attributed to nudibranchs is a case in point and, as the summaries of Costello (1938) and Miller (1961) show, there would appear to be several ways of

regarded as the most adapted. Populations which contribute the most offspring to the species' gene pool of the following generation relative to other populations may be regarded as the most fit. The
distinction between fitness and adaptedness recently has been expounded by Dobzhansky (1968). The definition of populational fitness presented here is based upon a permutation of Dobzhansky's view of
Darwinian fitness which he characterizes as ""the average contribution which the carriers of genotype, or of a class of genotypes, make to the gene pool of the following generation relative to the

Garibaldi feed almost exclusively on benthic organisms. Adults defend a territory
which includes a shelter hole, grazing area, and for some males, a nest site. The territory is defended all year and against some other species as well as other garibaldi. The nest site is a small
patch of red algae cultured by the male. The same site is used over a period of several years by the same male and probably by his successors. The female is allowed in the territory only to spawn; the
eggs are guarded by the male. The young receive no parental care; they disperse into the plankton and settle out in shallow water. Age estimates from scales indicate that garibaldi assume adult
coloration and mature at age 5 or 6 years and may live 13 or more years. Garibaldi have no obvious important predators or diseases. From age structures of several populations the mortality rate is
estimated at about 9\% of the adult population per year. In most cases potential recruitment more than balances mortality, indicating that population density is limited by some resource in the area
and regulated by some form of intraspecific competition. Density and dispersion of both fish and resources (food, shelter, and nest sites), sex ratio, and age structure were determined in several
study areas. From these data and a series of repopulation experiments, the most likely limiting and regulating factors are proposed. Density of adult garibaldi can be limited by supply of resources
for survival or, where these are abundant, by minimal space requirements of nesting males. Exclusion by territory defense helps regulate density to limits set by food, space, etc. There is no evidence
of feedback between density and the density limiting or regulating effects of territorial behavior. Territorial behavior seems to have evolved as a means of increasing reproductive success. Population
effects, though beneficial, are probably incidental. There is no support for the hypothesis that territorial behavior in the garibaldi has evolved because it limits or regulates density.","Clarke, Thomas A."

opportunity to study the relationship of chromosomal polymorphism and genetic load. Utilizing such materials, EPLING and co-workers have proposed that different gene arrangements contain essentially
different genetic complexes which tmd to be maintained throughout the distributional area of the species. Thus, they consider that the genetic load associated with a specific gene arrangement is
simply one aspect of its inherent genetic composition (EPLING, TINDERHOLT and MATTONI 1961 ; MAYHEW et al. 1966). These suggestions were based largely on studies of TL (Tree Line) gene arrangements
from widely different locations which were found to exhibit relatively high proportions of lethal plus semilethal genes and similar lethal mutation rates. Although there is little doubt that the
genetic makeup of the same gene arrangement varies, depending on its geographical source (DOBZHANSKY 1950) , recent findings do suggest that each gene arrangement has retained some of its primordial
genetic complex (PRAKASH and LEWONTIN 1968). DOBZHANSKY and co-workers have offered a different hypothesis to explain variation in genetic loads among different gene arrangements They suggested that
the genetic load exhibited by a particular gene arrangement depends on its frequency in the population and that rare gene arrangements will tend to carry more lethal genes than common ones. Their sug-
gestion appears to be based on the proposition that two or more heterotic systems (in this case heterotic systems of karyotypes and of alleles) will impose a smaller segregation load on a population
if they are linked in such a way that there is joint elimination of the less desirable karyotypes (i.e., the rarer ones) with the deleterious","Thomas, D. L. and Crumpacker, D."

literature reveals that acceptance or rejection of what philosophers or sociologists might call a ‘functionalist’ perspective or approach is not significant for the division of biologists into schools

immediately after. Changes in population density were associated with changes in the number of young alive per hen in August. Survival after August was about the same each year for all age groups,

been much more important in the evolution of the process. With the onset of very close range (virtually internal) fertilization, different selective pressures would operate on the female so as to

evidence from the measurements taken, that the male Earwig is polymorphic in any respect except in the size distribution of the cerci. This polymorphism is restricted to the lengths of the cerci: no
evidence was found to show that the lateral axes of the male cerci were polymodally distributed in any sample. Other findings indicated that the occurrence of the high male at the same place, was
variable in different years. There was evidence that the earwigs collected in the south were larger than those in the north, and the populations contained proportionately more high males. The female
earwigs were shown to be significantly larger than the males in almost all respects except in the cerci which are also dimorphic in shape. Comparisons were made between the Fame Islands' populations
of earwigs and those sampled on the mainland. The Fame Islands' earwigs are remarkably different from the mainland populations being much larger on average and containing far more high males. Other

genetically with other characters [4, 5]. The popularity ofthese ""non-adaptive"" theories is not difficult to understand. Most of the evolutionary theories about senescence, which directly invoke
natural selection, have been rather unsatisfying. Although there may be exceptions to the efficacy of natural selection [6], the process is so general that a character which is seemingly outside its
realm necessarily attracts attention. If in such situations we are able to find a plausible alternative model utilizing natural selection, it generally proves to be the more attractive explanation. It

patterns. These predictions are that (1) polyandry should be rare, (2) polygyny should be more common among mammals than among birds, (3) polygyny should be more prevalent among precocial than among
altricial birds, (4) conditions for polygyny should be met in marshes more regularly than among terrestrial environments, (5) polygyny should be more prevalent among species of early successional
habitats, (6) polygyny should be more prevalent among species in which feeding areas are widespread but nesting sites are restricted, and (7) polygyny should evolve more readily among species in which
clutch size is strongly influenced by factors other than the ability of the adults to provide food for the young. Most cases of polygyny in birds, a group in which monogamy is the most common mating

zoologism from an essay that Isaiah Berlin wrote in 1951 on Tolstoy. He tells us that, ""There is a line among the fragments of the Greek poet, Archilochus, which says: 'The fox knows many things, but
the hedgehog knows one big thing.' Scholars have diifered about the correct interpretation of these dark words, which may mean no more than that the fox, for all his cunning, is defeated by the
hedgehog's one defense. But, taken figuratively, the words can be made to yield a sense in which they mark one of the deepest differences which divide writers and thinkers, and, it may be, human
beings in general."" He goes on to propose that Tolstoy's greatness stems from being a fox by nature yet striving to be a hedgehog. I want to suggest that a similar ideal may be appropriate for
scientists as well. I think of the typical organismal biologist as something of a fox, elucidating the structural or physiological basis of some property of the organism, finding his ultimate
satisfaction in the completion of that undertaking, and then seeking another knot to unravel. He is inclined to be an empiricist. Ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and some animal behaviorists are
more often, I think, hedgehogs, grappling with unknowns which the individual investigator can rarely hope to understand completely even in a lifetime. Here we find more theorizing and?dare I say it?a
certain proclivity towards mysticism. Thus, I wish to distinguish organismal and populational biolo? gists on the basis of their predominant methodology rather than on the basis of their subject
matter, although it is obvious that the two are interdependent, and that the biases of each are productive and appropriate to the nature of the problems with which they deal. It should be clear that I
am not trying to make a distinction between good and bad research. I take it for granted that all good research has relevance beyond its immediate context, whatever the level of analysis. I am
thinking, rather, of the strategy that guides the choice of direction in which to pursue a problem, once initiated. The inclination to pursue a reductionist ap? proach is characteristically that of a
fox. A hedgehog will more readily look in the other direction, to the more emergent properties of the phenomenon under study. Whether a biologist is working with populations, or at the organizational
or molecular level, he can work creatively with either approach, but populational biology seems to be a special haven for hedgehogs, presumably because of the nature of the problems in the area. I
want to press the case for breeding more hybrids, or should I say for training ""fedgehoxes"", who will be organismal biol? ogists with an evolutionary approach to their subject, and populational

component of gene migration was inferred from pollinator flight distances, 1,614 of which were analyzed. Bees were the primary pollinators. The seed component of gene migration was measured in the
experimental garden, utilizing transplants as the seed source. Axial distances were determined for 2,309 wind-borne seeds. Means of pollinator flight distances displayed a close curvilinear
relationship to colony density, an increase in density being accompanied by a decrease in flight distance. Flights are predominately to near neighbors, and there is strong positive correlation between
the variance of flight distance and the variance of plant spacing. Thus we conclude that pollinator behavior and pollen-dispersal distance are density-dependent. Gene migration has been considered
within the framework of Wright's neighborhood model. Neighborhood area is density-dependent, the relationship between density and area being an inverse one. The dependency of Na on density is somewhat
obscured by the seed-dispersal variance, which is density-independent and which dominates the total gene-dispersal variance. Since gene migration is influenced by colony density, the potential for
local differentiation is to some extent density-dependent, high-density arrays being most conducive to subdivision. Genetically effective density increased with colony density. However, when only the
density-dependent component was considered, Ne remained relatively constant over the range of densities. This feature is traceable to the Ne equation, which includes a square function of spacing

individual alone in an “absolutely controlled” and usually empty environment as a theoretical model, and tries to work from this ground up to normal ecosystems by adding variables one at a time.","Menzel, E. W."

similar to wiping the bill as many birds may do after feeding, except that a Whitebreasted Nuthatch of either sex usually holds some object such as an insect in its bill, and swings its whole body in
an arc (Figure 1) as it sweeps back and forth over areas of bark by the nest entrance for many minutes at a time. It will occasionally sweep with the bill alone and at other times poke into an object,
such as the body of an insect, then dab at the bark as if applying whatever adheres to its bill. An overall view of bill-sweeping and objects used is given in Table 1. Period of nest building.-A pair

each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in
different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of
perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures
interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the
proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single
research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time
and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with
structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious
awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking
concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the
equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no
species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the
community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.","Hall, Edward T. and Birdwhistell, Ray L. and Bock, Bernhard and Bohannan, Paul and Diebold,, A.

generations. With this progressive enlargement of the population, reactions opposing growth are sequentially triggered off and the environmental resistance ultimately increases to the point where
continued growth is arrested. Equilibrium is again reached when the number of recruits is just suf ficient to compensate for the mortality which occurs in the population. Ecologiste have long
recognized that the stability of natural popula tions is controlled dynamically, meaning that the farther the numbers rise or fall, the stronger is the tendency to return to the previous level. This
happens through the operation of factors whose intensity of action varies with population density. Such density-dependent factors may influence either recruitment or mortality; hence, stability is
favored if the reproductive rate is highest at low densities, or if the death-rate is highest at high densities. The often complex processes that maintain population balance de veloped slowly in the
course of evolution. Insects, which have been present on this planet for about 400 million years, evolved very early in the geologic time scale. Today a close adjustment exists between them and their
essential resources and the violent fluctuations (pest outbreaks) that periodically occur are the result of some disbalance in the action of regulatory processes brought about naturally or, as is
often the case (e.g., in agriculture), due to man-made changes in the environment. Man, late to evolve, has been present for little more than a million years. He has many times threatened to reach the
carry ing capacity of his environment but on most occasions has migrated into new territory or modified his culture to extend it. In recent times he has turned from an agrarian economy to an
industrial one and he may continue to change his mode of living as the needs arise. However, his era of sustained population increase may be coming to an end. If the present rate of growth continues,
the population of man will double by the end of the present century and reach 20 billion by the middle of the next. Such growth is disproportionate to predicted rates of in crease in economic
development.","Harcourt, D. and Leroux, E."

96,odonald_general_1967,A general model of sexual and natural selection,1967-01-01,"FISHER in The Genetical Theory of JVatural Selection (1930) described how mating preferences might evolve by natural selection. If mating behaviour varies among different genotypes, some individuals
may have an hereditary disposition to mate with others having particular characteristics. Usually of course it is the females who choose the males and their choice is determined by the likelihood that
the males' display will release their mating responses. If some females prefer to mate with those males that have characteristics advantageous in natural selection, then the genotypes that determine
such matings will also be selected: the offspring will carry both the advantageous genotypes and the genotypes of the mating preference. Once the mating preference is established, it will itself add
to the selective advantage of the preferred genotypes: a ""runaway process"" as Fisher called it develops. In a paper in Heredity (1963) I described a mathematical model of this type of selection. In
the simplest case two loci must be involved: one locus determines the preferred character and the other the mating preference. If there are only two alleles segregating at each locus, ten different
genotypes can occur if the loci are linked and nine if they are not. If they are sex-linked, there are i possible genotypes. I derived finite difference equations giving the frequencies of the
genotypes in terms of parameters describing the degree of dominance of the preferred genotypes and the recombination fractions of the loci. They are complicated, non-linear equations and cannot be
solved explicitly. I could only obtain approximate solutions giving the rate of sexual selection at the start of the process and near its final equilibrium. I was unable to incorporate in the model
the effects of natural selection which is what starts off the runaway process. But I have now made a detailed numerical study of the equations using the Elliott 803 Computer here at the University
College of North Wales and the Atlas i Computer of the Science Research Council at Chilton, Berkshire. The computers were programmed to allow for any intensity of natural selection and for variations

ecologists. Wynne-Edwards (1962, 1965) has presented a large volume of evidence, much of it circumstantial and anecdotal, that the explanation of the apparent rarity of many vertebrates lies not
directly in environmental influences such as weather or immediate shortage of food but in social interactions which increase the death-rate or decrease the birth-rate before obvious crowding sets in.
Various laboratory studies (e.g. Strecker \& Emlen 1953; Terman 1965; see also a review by Christian \& Davis 1964) have tended to support this contention. Chitty (1960) suggested that time and
selection against genotypes present in the phase of rapid increase could also lead to the limitation of local populations. The existence of such self-restraining mechanisms has been convincingly
demonstrated for only a relatively small number of vertebrate species and, in some of these, environmental changes may upset the regulation (Davis 1953). But, because populations of many
invertebrates, particularly pest-insects, undergo spectacular rises and falls from season to season and year to year, hypotheses of selfregulation have not been so popular with students of
invertebrate ecology. A laboratory study of Tribolium (Brereton 1962) suggests that a self-restraining mechanism exists in this species, and Wellington (1964) has given evidence that in Malacosoma
genetic deterioration of local populations through differential emigration of the more active and hardy individuals can account for limitation of local populations even though the environment remains
favourable. The present paper supports the idea that the nature and importance of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms may depend on the degree to which the size of an animal population is capable of
influencing the quantity of limiting resources available to later generations. A number of accounts by other workers are examined from this point of view and new work is presented on the importance of
the pattern of population-dispersion in the use and conservation of food by two contrasted species, Dacus tryoni Frogg. (Diptera, Trypetidae) and Cactoblastis cactorum Berg. (Lepidoptera, Phycitidae).","Monro, J."

population control. Socio-economic factors may have controlled the size of the large pack. Availability of food during the period of parturition and rearing probably was critical to survival of young.
Recruitment of young appeared to take place in years of high production of moose calves. Numbers in the large pack probably were curtailed through the progressive exclusion of aged and socially
subordinate individuals. Under harassment these animals separated and became pack-following scavengers, then probably true loners ranging outside the area used by the pack. Smaller aggregations of two
or three non-breeders were seen each winter, as were the loners, some of which appeared thin and weak.  The only known breeding outside the big pack was in a group of five present in the winter of
1965. This group was probably a family unit which separated from the main pack. A year later the male had disappeared, and remains of a pup, probably theirs, were found. In the winter of 1966 the
alpha male of the large pack became lame and apparently was killed. This background appears favorable for further changes in social organization.","Jordan, Peter A. and Shelton, Philip C. and Allen, Durward L."

Slow maturation rates evolved in species where there is strong intraspecific

1965). The American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) has a slower maturation rate than other parulids, many males not breeding until their second spring. The purposes of this paper are (1) to
investigate the relationship between age of males (first-year vs. older') and type of habitat utilized, and (2) to suggest the proximate and ultimate factors responsible for the complex relationships
of plumage, behavior, and ecology in this species and some other passerines. The American Redstart has an extensive breeding range and in many areas is one of the most abundant breeding birds. It is
found in a variety of habitats including willow and alder thickets, deciduous, mixed deciduous and coniferous, and even primarily coniferous forests (Bent, 1953). The biology of the redstart is of
special interest in relation to the evolution of adaptations leading to success as measured by broad geographic range, utilization of a variety of habitats and high population density.","Ficken, M. and Ficken, R. W."

The rate usually changes with time as the population increases or
decreases. The objective of this study was determine whether the growth rate of animal populations is or is not a function of the population density. In most mathematical models of populations whose
changes resemble those of actual populations, the growth rate is a decreasing function of density, meaning that as the population increases the growth rate decreases and vice versa. Records of actual
populations can be used to test the relation between growth rate and density by calculating correlation coefficients for these two characteristics. The methods of doing this are described and the
limitations on the data are explained. The records of 111 different populations representing 71 species were analyzed by these methods. Of the 71 species, 7 were eliminated from further analysis
because their census records were not significantly different from a series of random numbers, 47 had correlation coefficients that were negative and significantly different from zero, 16 had
coefficients not significantly different from zero (all but one of these estimated coefficients were negative), and one, the world's human population, had a positive coefficient significantly
different from zero. There were no differences between taxonomic groups (insects other invertebrates, fish, birds, mammals). The primary conclusion is that in most animal species a population's growth
rate is a decreasing function of density. The explains the relative stability of animal populations, which never continue to increase at rates their fertility would allow, and rarely decrease to
extinction. Tentative conclusions are presented regarding the processes regulating population numbers. Populations of herbivorous insects at low and moderate levels are regulated by disease,
parasites, and predators causing mortality that is an increasing function of density. Favorable conditions may allow an increase in insect numbers so rapid that the population temporarily escapes
regulation by its enemies. Nonterritorial species of vertebrates are normally controlled by predation and, when that fails, by competition; in both cases juvenile individuals are most affected. In
territorial vertebrates competition for suitable territories determines the size of the breeding population. Populations of vertebrate species (expecting man) are in general regulated by the
production of adult individuals being a decreasing function of population density.","Tanner, James T."

This concern for social status is perhaps more conspicuous in
those societies, like the American, where the ruling ideology encourages a striving for upward social mobility, for movement to higher social status positions. But it seems to be no less important in
those societies, like the traditional Indian caste society, which prevent or strongly discourage upward mobility—for at least downward mobility is possible in every society as punishment for
nonfulfillment or certain social obligations. Thus the only difference is that in such less mobile societies, people’s concern for social status will take the form of simply trying to maintain their
existing status and caste positions and of avoiding all types of nonconformist behavior possibly endangering these positions.","Harsanyi, John C."

causes and functions of these signals. The squirrels produced six different calls: chirp, churr, squeal, squawk, teeth-clatter and growl. They used all the calls in agonistic behavior. An attack,
approach or sight of another animal nearby elicited most of the calls. The signals functioned to intimidate others or to inhibit them from moving closer. Squirrels chirped in response to airborne
predators and churred in response to ground predators. Spectrographic analysis indicated that these were the same calls the squirrels used in intraspecific threat. Their system of sound communication
was simple and unspecific. Its primary use seemed to be as a general attention-getter. Perhaps relying on visual and scent communication and living in relatively open habitat promoted the development
of their generalized system of sound communication.","Balph, D. M. and Balph, D. F."

Earlier, though, Old and New World monkeys' intelligence outdistanced that of other mammals,
including the prosimian primates. This first great advance in intelligence probably was selected through interspecific competition on the large continents. However, even at this early stage, primate
social life provided the evolutionary context of primate intelligence. Two arguments support this conclusion. One is ontogenetic: modern monkeys learn so much of their social behavior, and learn their
behavior toward food and toward other species through social example. The second is phylogenetic: some prosimians, the social lemurs, have evolved the usual primate type of society and social learning
without the capacity to manipulate objects as monkeys do. It thus seems likely that the rudiments of primate society preceded the growth of primate intelligence, made it possible, and determined its
nature.","Jolly, Alison"
474,chapman_food_1966,Food and {Space} as {Regulators} of {Salmonid} {Populations} in {Streams},1966-01-01,"In an attempt o synthesize a useful general hypothesis for natural regulation of populations, Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin (1960) concluded that plants are limited or controlled by a shortage of
nutrients, light, or water, or are resource-limited. Herbivorous trophic groups, they suggested, are largely controlled by predation, while predator and decomposer groups are food-limited. In other
words, all trophic groups but the herbivores are resource limited. Of course this hypothesis is a general and broad one. Looking at specific animals of a given trophic group it is difficult o find a
common mechanism of population regulation. In some cases man's influence has changed the mode of control from predator to food, as has occurred in many big-game populations. For some freshwater fish
populations, Larkin (1956) indicates that climatic controls seem to outweigh biological factors in controlling numbers. Possibly this could be explained by environmental stability. In unstable
situations climate may prevail as more than a ""density legislative"" (Nicholson, 1954) factor. In more benign environments, intraand inter-specific competition and predation become more important as
""density governors"" in the stable framework legislated by the physical environment. Larkin suggests that in such situations inter-specific competition predisposes fish to loss from other causes,
notably predation. Larkin states that freshwater environments offer comparatively little opportunity for specialization in fish (when compared with terrestrial environments). Therefore, many species
have wide tolerance of habitat type and flexible feeding habits, leading to breadth at each level of the food chain rather than height of a pyramid of numbers.","Chapman, D. W."

obvious, such as that between husband and wife, are not necessarily universal. On what bases do humans co-operate? Social anthropoligists look at co-operation primarily from the point of view of
social relations. In this they share common ground with the ethologists who analyse the social behaviour of animals. Among human beings the social relations which go to make up such activities are
complex. Anthropologists take them apart and analyse them in terms of roles, kinship, local grouping, hierarchy, economic relations and ritual relations. Social anthropologists often, though not
always, take as their subject matter so-called ""primitive societies"". By primitive we usually mean four things:","Benedict, B."

of Allocation"" (Levins and MacArthur, unpublished), and one of its applications might be the formulation of a general theory to account for clutch size in birds. At this stage we will assume that
clutch size is a hereditary phenotypic characteristic which can be affected to a greater or lesser extent by the prevailing environmental conditions and which ex- hibits the normal variability of such
char- acteristics. Lack (1954) discusses the validity of several hypotheses which' at- tempt to account for clutch size and its variation under different circumstances and conditions, all of which
were rejected in favor of his now widely accepted theory that clutch size is adapted to a limited food supply. This paper is an attempt to show that this and other existing hypotheses when taken
singly are inadequate in some respect to account for all the data, that each holds for some particular set of con- ditions, and that each is but a part of the complete explanation. The theories will

and a higher percentage of pregnancies among these older females. Seventeen families, representing the entire social system of one island, showed that about three quarters were adult (equally divided
between the sexes but with fewer older males than females) and the remaining quarter were immature (with an equal sex ratio). Half of the adult females were either pregnant or suckling young. The mean
family size is seven which includes peripheral males. Group size and composition as well as adult to immature proportions compared closely with data on A. caraya in the Chaco of Argentina and the 1951

I then showed why the term is obsolete (except certain
restricted applications in areas of prehistoric cultures and the like) and suggested some reasons why it nevertheless flourishes in anthropological thought today. Diamond's main argument is that I
have made but a ""patchwork survey of the random use of the term primitive"" (note his use of the word random). Specifically, he asserts that I have omitted certain works (he mentions only Morgan and a
book edited by Evans-Pritchard), and have not given enough consideration to his ""10 point outline of a functional model of primitive society."" Since I did not claim to have attempted a history of the
use of the term and stated the scope of my survey clearly, I am at a loss to why Diamond accuses me of being ""seriously interested in pursuing the history of the concept primitive.. ."" Should one be
accused of neglecting to do something which he expressly states that he is not doing? On the other hand Diamond would have been more effective in his criticism if he had been able to point up
specifically how either of the omitted sources yielded new facts or insights which would have made the central point of my article untenable. The 30 books we examined represent, as we intended, a
broad selection of recent works and my conclusions based upon them are no less valid because several items were not included. As to why I did not ""substantially discuss"" Diamond's ""10 point outline of
a functional model of primitive society"", the reason is obvious. He has certainly tried to make a number of distinctions, uch as those between form differentiation and functional equivalence (which I
understand), or between ""contemporary crumbling of primitive societies ... and the necessity of understanding their historical existence for the sake of man's present and future"" (which I do not see
as a scientifically fruitful proposition). And he certainly has tried to set up a series of criteria for the term ""primitive"". However, by his own admission, his criteria seem to have little or
nothing to do with the facts that I gathered from books by active contemporary anthropologists who are now shaping the course of our discipline. For Diamond says in his critique of my article: ""... it
would have been, to say the least, more candid for Hsu to have recognized the distinctions I draw between primitive societies and archaic civilizations, together with my conclusion that the majority
of anthropologists have worked with local groups ii archaic civilizations, and not in primitive societies."" (Italius mine). In other words, Diamond's elaborate criteria, as he himself has said, apply
only' to societies other than those with which the majority of anthropologists have been concerned. Considering this, I think that I was not far wrong when I said in my article that Diamond's
""interesting efforts"" would not ""appreciably help to restore the concept of primitive to the central place it once unquestionably occupied in anthropology"" (Hsu 1964:176). Becker's critique begins
with an unexplained assertion that my paper ""will simply not do"" what I intended, because ""anthropology cannot do without an idea of man."" Quite apart from the fact that my article never even remotely
suggested that anthropology should do without an idea of man, I find Becker's idea of man, to which he would have given central importance, most interesting. He claims that anthropology ""has been
evolving an idea of man for the past 150 years, or contributing to the evolution of such an idea in all the major thinkers of our times,"" ""who are shaping the thought of today."" But a scrutiny of his
list of 13 thinkers shows that not one is from the non-Western world. In fact, not even one of them is from Eastern European countries, such as Russia. If this is the idea of man anthropology has been
working on, then our discipline has contributed nothing to it and learned nothing from our study of different societies and cultures. Fortunately the actual world of anthropology and anthropologists
is quite different from what Becker imagines or wishes it to be.","Burger, Henry G. and Kurten, Bjorn and Mech, L. David and Shaw, Thurstan and Hewes, Gordon W. and La Barre, Weston and Fernandez, Frank and Ascher, Robert and Hockett, Charles F."

According to McNeill (1926) the species ranges northward from southern New South Wales and from
Perth, Western Australia, to New Caledonia in the east, to Singapore in the north, and to the Bay of Bengal in the west. In Australia Mictyris is known as the ""soldier crab."" This appellation is
appropriate in view of the habits of the genus . Immense numbers of M. longicarpus (Figs. 1 and 2 ) congregate in dense masses and wander over tidal flats in apparent formation. Their activities exert
a particular fascination not only because of these huge ""armies,"" but also because soldier crabs walk forward and not sideways, as do most crabs. Several authors have commented on the habit of
Mictyris of wandering in armies (MeNeill, 1926; Lazarus, 1945; Balss, 1955-56; AItevogr, 1957; Schone, 1961; Stephenson, 1961). However, little is known of the organisation of this behaviour and I
decided to study M. longi carpus with a view to describing it. Because of the immediate flight and burrowing reactions of soldier crabs to the disturbing influence of observers , the pattern of
behaviour to be described has been previously overlooked.","Cameron, A."

iguanid lizards. It is tentatively concluded that (a) small size of Uta on the continent and on large islands is largely affected by interspecific interactions with other iguanid lizards; (b) the
intensity of this inhibition to evolutionary increase in size is dependent (but not linearly) on the number of iguanid species interacting with Uta. Other supporting evidence for the existence of
interspecific phenomena affecting the ecology and distribution of lizards is presented. 2) The relative size of scales on the dorsal surface of the body is found to be significantly correlated with
the area of the island. This and other data on the geographic variation of scales of North American reptiles support the hypothesis that scales are thermoregulatory structures important in heat
exchange with the environment, and that scale size and form is partly determined by the selective effects of climate. 3) The extremely high densities of some insular populations of Uta is interpreted
as an evolutionary response to new food sources, assuming, of course, an hereditary component in the behavioral mechanisms that determine territory size. In continental areas, gene flow impedes
adaptation to such local peculiarities in the availability of food. 4) The existence of the above patterns in the geographic variation of body size, scale size, and population density testifies to the
importance of environmental selective trends in the evolutionary control of these insular lizard populations.","Soule, Michael"

Two types of territories were found: (a) small individual
plots, 15-30 m in diameter, aggregated in tight clusters that are called leks, arenas, or territorial breeding grounds (TGs) ; (b) larger territories of 100-200 m diameter, distributed between the
arenas, called single territories (STs). The largely permanent TGs, to which most of the breeding is confined, provide the basis for a social organization of the kob population of ca. 15 000. A
certain number of kob are, by tradition, attached to a particular TG, so that the total population is subdivided into units, each associated with one TG. STs are spread out between the TGs; their
size, number, and distribution vary with season and local conditions. There is an irregular gradient in size and density of territories from the center of a TG through the STs in its vicinity. STs may
be aggregated in loose clusters used as temporary or seasonal TGs. Permanent TGs may arise from such clusters. Abandonment of existing and formation of new TGs are relatively rare. The males on the
STs are strongly attached to confined areas which they defend against intruding males. Competition for STs is not intense, but males are occasionally replaced. Males defeated from their STs join a
male herd and may attempt later to reoccupy the same ST, often successfully. Whistling probably serves for marking the territory or for attracting females to it. Herds of females often pass through or
stay on STs, but the males do not possess harems. They court the female and attempt to copulate with them, but most females avoid their approaches. Few copulations occur on the STs; in several cases
the females involved proved to be physiologically abnormal, and it is concluded that the males on STs do not contribute significantly to the reproduction of the population. The daily activity of males
on the STs is compared with that of males on TGs. The latter spend less time for feeding and have less food available on their territories; this, combined with the higher proportions of fighting and
sexual behavior on TGs, is propably the main reason for the much higher rate of interchange of males on TGs compared with STs. Also, the degree of competition for territories is higher on TGs than
STS. The males of the kob population studied are, on the whole, divided into two categories: Those frequenting TGs, and those staying on STs. Both types join a male herd when they are not territorial.
The age distribution among males on TGs and those on STs is largely equal. Some males occupied both territories on a TG and STs, but such cases are relatively rare. Two young-adult males first
occupied a ST for some time, before they appeared on a TG, but this course of behavioral development does not seem to be the general rule. Territorial behavior was found in several other kob
populations; the relative number of STs and the development of TGs vary considerably between different areas. Territoriality and lek behavior in other ungulates are briefly reviewed. The Uganda kob is
the only antelope known, so far, to exhibit typical lek behavior. In addition, behavioral polymorphism such as the occurrence of different types of territories within the same population has not yet
been found in any other species of antelopes. The following conclusions pertaining to the Uganda kob are drawn: STs are the original form of territoriality, still prevalent in small or marginal
populations. In large and dense populations the formation of TGs offers certain ecologic advantages, such as providing a social organization and a spacing mechanism to the population and ensuring
maximum efficiency of reproduction. Despite these advantages of TGs over STs the latter have not disappeared. Either they provide some social advantage, as yet unknown, or their persistence ensures
adaptive plasticity of local populations and the species as a whole, to meet emergencies brought about by changes in the environment.","Leuthold, Walter"

Many of the studies bearing on this question
have been initiated because of the unusual characteristics of certain populations. For instance, they have dealt with extreme interpopulation variability in Cepaea and striking differences in
composition of young and adult samples of Natrix. In other cases, marked changes in populations through time (as in Biston betularia) have attracted the attention of biologists. These investigations
generally have led to the conclusion that rapid evolutionary changes are taking place, and in particular they have led to the detection of high selection pressures. It now seems that while very
gradual changes theoretically can account for the known evolutionary history of organisms, rapid changes are reasonably frequent in nature. It is not clear, however, whether these rapid changes tend
to oscillate or to occur only sporadically, so that the long-term effects may be similar to those which would result from relatively constant slow selection. The sampling of microevolutionary
situations represented by these studies is neither large enough nor sufficiently unbiased to permit reasonable statements about patterns of microevolutionary rates, or about the relative magnitude of
factors contributing to these rates. One partial solution to this sampling problem is to investigate populations chosen neither because of some unusual characteristic, nor","Ehrlich, Paul R."

Thirteen neighboring
nighthawk breeding home ranges in the center of Detroit, Michigan in- cluded on the average 10.4 ha total area, 97 small trees (including large shrubs), 70 large trees, and 38 flat roofs, representing
2.25 ha. More or less centrally in each home range and preferentially over flat roofs, whether being used for nesting or not, resident males performed diving and booming displays. High average and
minimum distances between the centers of activity of the residents, together with observations of conflict between neighbors indicated that the home ranges were mostly defended and, since including
feeding and breeding activities, constituted type A territories. Home range size which varied more than threefold, showed no significant correlation with the density of any environmental feature,
including an index of photosynthesis, except for a negative correlation with number of flat roofs per ha. Six of the 13 home ranges bounded a 42 ha area unoccupied by nighthawks, which was, compared
with the home ranges, deficient in trees and especially in flat roofs. These six home ranges tended to be larger than the remaining seven, though not to differ from them in density of trees and roofs,
and in neither group was there correlation between size and density of these features. Thus, variation in home range size seems best explained by birds settling thickly where flat roofs are numerous,
and through mutual aggressiveness having small home ranges, by birds not settling at all where flat roofs are scarce, and by home ranges next to such unoccupied areas expanding into them and/or at the
expense of neighbors who must defend their entire boundaries. Although nighthawks do not always defend combined nesting and feeding areas, the apparently primary importance of aggressive interaction
in determining home range size, in the present study, suggests that in nighthawks, as well as in other species having more strictly type A territories, aggressiveness at high population levels may
reduce the proportion of individuals breeding and population natality rate below what resources would allow. A variety of evidence is reviewed on this point including the interspecific variation of
home range size in relation to body mass which suggests that bird home ranges generally contain more food re- sources than required by the occupants.","Armstrong, Joseph T."

community ecology or competition are poorly known. The few recent detailed studies of interspecific behavior (Simmons, 1951; Rand, 1954; Lanyon, 1957; Selander and Giller, 1959, 1961; Moynihan, 1962,
1963; Orians and Collier, 1963; Orians and Willson, 1964) have exposed new approaches to investigations of ecological relationships (see Wynne-Edwards, 1962). This study was undertaken to examine the
nature and effects of behavioral interactions between two icterids, the Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius pkieniceus) and the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), in a situation where the two species
were breeding together in a small cattail marsh and were as a consequence potentially in competition. Red-wings nest in a wide range of habitats, but usually are closely associated with marshes and,
indeed, are often the ""dominant species"" of the Nearctic marsh avifauna (Allen, 1914). Grackles, while being quite adaptable in their nesting habits and utilizing a wide range of nesting substrates
(see Bent, 1958), apparently only sporadically nest in marshes. Indeed, Beecher (1942), in analyzing nesting substrates of several species in relation to available edge growth, concluded that cattails
were ""pessimum"" substrate for grackles and ""supra-optimum"" for Red-wings. Thus in a situation in which both species utilize marsh flora for nesting substrate, any interpretation of the relationships
between the species must recognize that the habitat is typical for Red-wings and unusual for grackles.","Wiens, John A."

grackles of the genus Quiscalus, the nestling sex ratio is balanced but differential mortality in the sexes following the nestling stage produces a marked imbalance in the tertiary sex ratio in favor
of females. Further imbalance in the sex ratio at the breeding colonies results from the failure of first-year males to breed. Imbalances in the tertiary sex ratio of the population and in the sex
ratio at breeding colonies are viewed as consequences of the promiscuous mating system rather than as causal factors promoting promiscuity. An explanation for the failure of first-year males of
polygynous and promiscuous species to participate in the breeding effort of the population is sought in terms of individual rather than group selection. Because the probability of a young male
obtaining mates in competition with older, experienced males is very low, males which postpone breeding may ultimately have greater total reproduction; and through selection first-year males have
become adaptively ""handicapped"" physiologically and morphologically in competition with adult males for mates. The fact that sympatric hybridization is more frequent among non-monogamous species than
among those having a monogamous mating system is attributed in part to the higher sex ""drive"" and the lower thresholds of response of males to feminine releasers, which arise through strong sexual
selection in polygamous and promiscuous mating systems. It is also suggested that the heightened aggressive tendencies of non-mono gamous males place a premium on feminine characters which minimize
the chances of the female eliciting aggressive responses on the part of the male at the time of mating.","Selander, Robert K."

the years 1958 to 1964.  For two age classes, adult and yearling, the characteristics of the following cycles were compared and correlated. The cycle of increase in size of the testes, the cycle of
increase in diameter of the seminiferous tubules, the cycle of the development of the stages of spermatogenesis, the cycles of relative and absolute increase of the interstitium and the cycles of
abundance of interstitial cells. Samples of sperm from these two age classes were compared. Furthermore, these cycles were compared with migration, with the period of egg laying in the female, with
behaviour, with age of the bird over two years of age and with body weight.  In all these tests, the yearlings had a shorter breeding cycle characterised by a slower recrudescence, a delayed and
shorter breeding period, a faster and an earlier regression. Although the yearlings had smaller testes and a lesser amount of tubular tissue, they all seemed to develop all the stages of
spermatogenesis and to produce fertile sperm. The smaller amount of intertubular tissue in yearlings was suspected to be correlated with their secretive behaviour and the smaller growth of the testes
of the yearlings was attributed to an inherited character rather than to inhibition by the environments, No difference was found in the testicular cycle between hooting and silent males and between
replacement or territorial yearlings and silent ones.  It was concluded that all male birds present on the breeding range were apparently potential breeders. Smaller interstitium and delayed maturity
seemed to be the main factors preventing the young birds from adding to the population of breeders.","Simard, Benjamin Raymond-Marie"
0,mckinney_spacing_1965,Spacing and chasing in breeding ducks,1965-01-01,"The behaviour of breeding ducks is described in terms of the relationship of the pair to its home range and the responses of pairs to one another. There are specific, sex, and seasonal variations in
the characteristics of the home range. Interactions between pairs involve five types of response: displays, attack, escape and avoidance, sexual pursuit, sociability. Chasing activities of paired
males can be hostile or sexual in nature, the latter involving attempts to rape strange females. The characteristics of aerial pursuits ('three-bird flights' and 'attempted rape flights') of Anas
species are believed to be determined by variations in the pursuing male's tendencies to (a) stay with or near his mate, (b) attack other males, (c) rape strange females. Male hostility is associated
with the existence of a strong pair-bond; raping is associated with a weak bond. A typical 'three-bird flight' results from conflict between the pursuing male's tendency to chase the female of a
strange pair (with intent to rape and/or possibly attack her) and his tendency to remain near his mate. Parts of the home range of each pair are shared with other pairs. Where a shared resource is
localised in distribution, such as an island suitable for nesting, pairs tend to aggregate. Colonial nesting develops as a result of strong horning tendency in adult and young females, and high
productivity in an area with light predation. The behaviour of a number of species appears to be adapted to the various types of resource-sharing required in different habitats. Chasing activities -
both hostile and sexual in nature - are believed to bring about dispersion of various types. In a species with a small home range, a high level of hostility, and a strong pair-bond (e.g. Shoveler), a
pattern close to classical 'territorialism' is apparent. In more mobile species, there is much overlapping of ranges and the degree of dispersion of pairs (and resulting dispersion of nests) can vary
considerably with local conditions. The primary function of chasing and the spacing resulting from it is thought to be the dispersion of nests as au and-predator mechanism.","Mckinney, F."
141,hogan-warburg_social_2002,"Social {Behavior} of the {Ruff}, {Philomachus} {Pugnax} ({L}.)",2002-01-01,"INTRODUCTION A. SCOPE OF THE STUDY The Ruff, Philomachus pugnax(L.), differs from other waders in its breeding behavior: courtship and mating take place on a communal display ground or lek; no sounds
are uttered during these activities; nesting behavior, incubation, and parental care are the exclusive task of the female. The Ruff is also distinguished by its sexual dimorphism in both size and
plumage, and by the extreme individual diversity in the male nuptial plumage. The earliest published accounts of behavior on the lek are those of SELOUS (1906, 1907), a pioneer in the field study of
bird behavior. Interested in the Darwinian concept of sexual selection, SELOUS objectively described the interactions among the individual males and females on the lek in an attempt to gather
information on partner choice on the lek and, specifically, on the function of figh6ng among the males. His descriptions and interpretations of this behavior are remarkably good considering the date
at which they were made. Other accounts of field studies on the breeding behavior of the Ruff have since been published (PORTIELJE 1931; ANDERSEN 1944, 1948, 1951; LINDEMANN 1951; BANCKE \& MEESENBURG
1952, 1958; MILDENBERGER 1953), and a number of authors have made comments on different aspects of the Ruff's breeding behavior (e.g., CHRISTOLEIT 1924; ARMSTRONG 1947; TINBERGEN 1959; WYNNE-EDWARDS
1962). VAN OORDT and JUNGE (1934, 1936) have investigated the endocrinological aspects of the development of the male nuptial plumage. LINDEMANN (1951) and GOETHE (1953) describe and comment on the
extent of the plumage diversity among the males. The present study extends the observations on the lek behavior and morphological features in the external appearance of the Ruff. Specifically, this is
an ethological study of the lek behavior of the Ruff which investigates the social organization of the lek community and the behavior patterns that serve mutual communication among the birds. It is
assumed that the behavior patterns provide many clues for the understanding of the social organization. Further, particular attention is paid to the biological significance of the plumage diversity
within the lek community. Accidentally, this study revealed that the Ruff presents an extreme example of behavioral polymorphism: it appears that within the male community two groups of males coexist
which show distinct differences in behavior. In a complicated way these behavioral differences are associated with differences in the external appearance of the individual males. This paper is
organized in the following manner. Descriptive data on morphologicai features in the external appearance of the Ruff are presented in Chapter II. Mutual relations within the male community,
correlations of behavioral differences with external appearance, and the intersexual relations during courtship are dealt with in Chapter III; the typical situations on the lek in which the behavior
patterns occur are also described in this chapter. Detailed descriptions of the form of these behavior patterns are presented in Chapter IV. Chapter V is concerned with a discussion of different
aspects of the behavioral polymorphism and the plumage diversity in the male Ruff. ... Zie: Introduction","Hogan-Warburg, A. J."

Numbers"" and antecedent papers. His conclusion, of utmost simplicity, is that natural selection will favor the individual (or pair) that contributes the greatest number of effective breeding
individuals to following generations. Therefore, the reproductive rate of any species or population will tend to approximate the maximum number of young its members can produce under average
prevailing conditions. In this context ""average"" may represent a long time indeed and species that cannot accommodate themselves to extreme conditions that recur no oftener than every several thousand
years may be wiped out. It is probable that the reproductive rates of all living things have this selective basis. Conditions have varied enormously, however, and thus we find some organisms which
produce great numbers of eggs, others that bring forth fewer young, but in a more advanced state of development, and still others that have only a few young but care for them carefully. To mention
only large predators, at or near the top of their food chains, it is instructive to compare the number of eggs or young produced by sharks, pike (Esox), crocodiles, bears, and eagles. All birds, with
unimportant exceptions, lay relatively few eggs. These they incubate, and later they care for the young. Nevertheless, there is quite a contrast between a wren (Troglodytes aedon) that raises two or
three broods of four or five young each in a season and a California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) which raises, at the most, one young every other year. Indeed the reproductive rate in this condor
and in a few other birds mentioned later is so low that it is difficult to believe that it does, in fact, represent the maximum possible rate under the conditions that confront these species. This was
brought out in a paper by V. C. WLnneEdwards (1945). He is of the opinion that some other selective basis must be found, and advanced a theory of population control or ""numerical homeostasis""
(Buechner, 1963) based upon group or social behavior. Social awareness, it is implied, will limit population density and prevent overexploitation of the food supply. These ideas were developed in
Wynne-Edwards (.1962) later book ""Animal Dispersion."" It is the present writer's belief that the reproductive rates of all birds can be best explained in terms of natural selection as analyzed by Lack
and that Wynne-Edwards' theory is without a sound genetic basis just insofar as he departs from it. Before seeking to demonstrate this it is necessary to summarize the reproductive ecology of the
species of birds that are in part at least responsible for the difference of opinion. The low reproductive rates of certain large birds involve the following factors: a (1) Clutch size. Some of the
largest raptors such as the Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus), the California Condor, and the Martial Eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) lay invariably one egg per clutch; others like the Crowned Eagle
(Stephanoaetus coronatus) sometimes one egg, sometimes two. All of these species lay relatively small eggs and there is no physical reason why they could not lay and incubate a clutch of several eggs.
Clutches of a single egg, while unusual among birds, do occur in various other forms such as some of the tropical pigeons, the lyrebirds (Menura), the larger penguins, and all of the petrels

as Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Diptera and Trichoptera in which all members of a population pass through the water-surface when emerging. Methods by which emergence rate can be measured are
discussed. Four basic temporal patterns of emergence exist. Emergence may be (1) continuous with irregular fluctuations in rate; (2) rhythmic, with a lunar period; (3) sporadic, occurring at irregular
intervals of a few days; or (4) seasonal. Examples of each of these patterns are given, and reference is made to the proximate and ultimate environmental factors which may be maintaining the patterns
observed. Diurnal rhythms of emergence are excluded from consideration. When emergence is restricted seasonally in temperate latitudes, the degree of its synchronization within the emergence period
varies widely but is usually constant and typical for a given species. This has provided the basis for an ecological classification of British Odonata, the validity of which is examined in the light
of recent research.","Corbet, Philip S."

Its distribution has been reduced drastically by changes in land use and management
(Aldrich, 1963). Attrition of suitable habitat has resulted in reduced prairie chicken populations throughout most of their present range. Such a reduction in numbers has generated concern for their
well-being by conservation minded biologists of North America. Many data have been collected of greater prairie chicken population dynamics, habitat requirements and preferences, distribution, food
habits, and other such facts of a general nature. Most studies have been confined to areas where greater prairie chicken numbers are moderate to low. Greatest efforts are often found where populations
near extinction. Few studies have been made in areas where greater prairie chicken populations are high and stable. Greater prairie chickens are social birds that exhibit a breeding display during
spring months. The display involves primarily males and the area on which the display is conducted is termed a booming or dancing ground. Such a group display by male birds is similar to leks of black
cocks (Lyrurus tetrix) (Selous, 1909), hooting grounds of sharptailed grouse (Pedioecetes phasianellus) (Scott, 1950), and strutting grounds of sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) (Dalke, et al.,
1963). Territorial behavior displayed on leks, strutting grounds, hooting grounds and booming grounds is an integral force in the natural regulation of Tetraonid populations (Tinbergen, 1957; Wynn-
Edwards, 1962). An early descriptive study of greater prairie chicken booming activity was made by Brickenridge (1929). More thorough and complete studies have followed, e.g., Hamerstrom (1941),
Schwartz (1945) and Hamerstorm and Hamerstrom (1955). Most recent greater prairie chicken studies have involved primarily population changes or other such management related aspects of a recreational

The intensity of the movement varied in the three years.
Environmental causes for this movement were considered; temperature changes, precipitation or crowding do not seem to be operating. Samples of the tadpole populations were examined and the metamorphic
changes prior to emigration are rapid and regular. With final metamorphosis into juvenile frogs, the emigration suddenly begins. It appears to be triggered by internal events related to maturation.
During the evening of 8 July 1961, a massive swarm of juvenile frogs left the waters of Garlock Slough in Dickinson County, Iowa, and moved into the surrounding hills of grass and cropland so that the
tall grass was alive with small frogs. They crossed an adjacent highway in such numbers that automobi:es crushed a carpet of frog viscera. This emigration continue:l at a decreasing rate for the next

Consideration is restricted toextinction operators
acting at ornear to carrying capacity. Under the assumption that the extinction rate is large relative to individual genetic parameters affecting gene frequencies in boundary populations, we discuss
the conditions under which differential extinction is most likely to produce a significant effect. In particular, a condition for bimodality in the distribution of gene frequencies in boundary
populations (population polymorphism) is that there be some critical allele frequency at which the extinction rate jumps from high to low. An extinction operator linear in allele frequency produces no
qualitative effect of this kind. In consequence, we are able to make precise rather limited circumstances under which group selection is likely to have a significant effect. In a recent paper, Levins
(1) has tried to analyze mathematically the effects of group selection acting via differential extinction. Unfortunately, the credibility of his results is greatly reduced by an invalid stability
criterion, which assumes that finite-dimensional stability theory can be automatically extended to an infinite-dimensional moment space, and by absence of a well-founded derivation of the fundamental
Fokker-Planck equation. The present paper communicates the main implications of a different but similar model that is analytically quite tractable and also substantively realistic for a range of
conditions under which group selection may be likely to have a significant effect; derivations and simulation results will be published in detail elsewhere. We focus on the effects of group selection
along the boundary of a large ""mainland"" population, whose genetic characteristics remain fixed in the time period under consideration. Along the boundary, this large population is assumed to break up
into a large number of small micropopulations. As in the case of Levins' model (1), differential extinction acts on these micropopulations as a function of micropopulation gene frequency. Making
explicit an additional assumption of Levins, we restrict attention to extinction operators that act at or near to carrying capacity, as distinct from those that might act in the propagule stage (this
distinction is a kind of group analog to the standard distinction between rand K-selection). Substantively, focus on extinction acting only at carrying capacity corresponds closely to the classical

population beyond the limits of food supply. For simplicity (though not by necessity), we develop the formal treatment in terms of a single biallelic locus. Differential extinction is assumed to favor
one allele at this locus. In formal terms, we assume that the extinction operator E(x) as a function of x (the frequency of the given allele in a particular boundary inicropopulation) is monotone
decreasing; again, this corresponds to the treatment by Levins (1). This differential extinction favoring one allele along the boundary is then opposed to mendelian selection favoring the opposite
allele. Without essential loss, we can assume in a first model that the action of individual selection affects only the equilibrium allele frequency in the mainland population. Indirectly, then, this
selection pressure will affect the boundary populations because of gene exchange between each boundary population and the mainland. The result is that we do not need to concern ourselves with
essentially irrelevant specification of a particular form of genetic control at the locus in question (mendelian dominance, additive fitness, heterozygote superiority, etc.). Hence, in this first
approximation we have only forces of extinction, migration, and drift acting on each boundary population. Under these conditions, we proceed by a modification of the method of diffusion equations (3)
to set up a model of the distribution of gene frequencies within micropopulations along the boundary. Actually, we use a diffusion-equation approach in name only; the approximation we actually use
trivializes our diffusion equation, and reduces it to an ordinary differenential equation (see Eqs. 1 and 2 below). Specifically, consider a cohort of boundary populations starting at carrying
capacity at time t = 0. The assumption that the populations are at carrying capacity means that we can neglect the effects of population fluctuation, and hence can formalize drift effects by methods
standard in population genetics. Let x be the frequency of the allele favored by group selection. Each boundary population has a gene frequency distribution evolving through time, and governed by the
following partial differential equation: a; (x,t) = -E(x)Vb(x,t) + (62 [Vs'(xt)I [MaX41(.Xtt] [1] where 41(x,t) is the joint distribution that a population will exist and have allele frequency x at

Notably, models using Bayesian agents
provide a precise specification of (extra-)liguististic factors (e.g., genetic) that shape language through iterated learning (biases on language), and demonstrate that weak biases get expressed more
strongly over time (bias amplification). Other models attempt to lessen assumption on agents’ innate predispositions even more, and emphasize self-organization within agents, highlighting
glossogenesis (the development of language from a nonlinguistic state). Ultimately however, one also has to recognize that biology and culture are strongly interacting, forming a coevolving system. As
such, computer models show that agents might (biologically) evolve to a state predisposed to language adaptability, where (culturally) stable language features might get assimilated into the genome
via Baldwinian niche construction. In summary, while many questions about language evolution remain unanswered, it is clear that it is not to be completely understood from a purely biological,
cognitivist perspective. Language should be regarded as (partially) emerging on the social interactions between large populations of speakers. In this context, agent models provide a sound approach to
investigate the complex dynamics of genetic biasing on language and speech.","Janssen, R. and Dediu, D."

Group
selection for both increased and decreased adult population size was carried out among laboratory populations of Tribolium castaneum at 37-day intervals. The effect of individual selection within
populations on adult population size was evaluated in an additional control series of populations. The response in the group selection treatments occurred rapidly, within three or four generations,
and was large in magnitude, at times differing from the controls by over 200\%. This response to selection at the populational level occurred despite strong individual selection which caused a decline
in the mean size of the control populations from over 200 adults to near 50 adults in nine 37-day intervals. ""Assay"" experiments indicated that selective changes in fecundity, deve opmental time, body
weight, and cannibalism rates were responsible in part for the observed treatment differences in adult population size. These findings have implications in terms of speciation in organisms whose range
is composed of many partially isolated local populations. Much of the theoretical and experimental work in population genetics has been concerned with genetic changes within single panmictic
populations or in a collection of permanent populations with some gene flow between them (1, 2). Such work cannot be applied to those cases of biological interest in which populations are going
extinct and being recolonized at rates comparable to the time scale of genetic changes within single populations (3, 4). Ecological theory, on the other hand, has attempted with some success to
predict the dynamics and the effects of subdividing a species range into a large number of local habitats (5-7). Although extinction and recolonization are important factors in this work, it remains
mainly nongenetic and theoretical in character. Selection at the populational level or group selection is defined as genetic change that is brought about or maintained by the differential extinction
and/or proliferation of populations. Intergroup selection has been proposed by many workers on theoretical grounds as a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic and social behaviors (8-15).
However, the evolution of any trait, not necessarily social, that affects the likelihood of a population becoming extinct or establishing colonizing propagules will be influenced by intergroup
selection (16, 17). This report summarizes the major features of an extensive empirical study of the genetical effects of extinction and recolonization in laboratory populations of the flour beetle,
Tribolium castaneum (18). The character chosen for group selection was numbers of adults in a population at intervals of 37 days. Previous work (19-21) has shown that the number of adult beetles at
this time is highly correlated with the probability of and time to extinction of a population and with the tendency of adult beetles to emigrate. Standard conditions were observed during the
husbanding and censusing of the populations (22). The experiment consisted of four treatments (Fig. 1): treatment A, group selection for high numbers of adults per population; treatment B, group
selection for low numbers of adults per population; treatment C, no group selection; individual selection within the populations was allowed to determine the numbers of adults per population; and
treatment D, random group selection, i.e., selection and dispersion of populations by means of a table of random numbers. In treatment A, that population with the largest number of adults at the
37-day census was selected and divided into as many groups of 16 adults as possible. One new population was then founded with each group of 16. The population with the second highest number of adults
was then chosen and likewise divided into propagules of 16 adults. Group selection for large numbers of adults was continued in this manner until 48 new populations had been established. In treatment
B, the procedure was identical to that described for A except that the populations with the lowest numbers of adults were selected and divided. Treatment D was similar to A and B, but in this case a
table of random numbers was used to select the populations. Treatment D permits a comparison of the effect of random with directed extinctions (A and B). Treatment C was designed to be a control
treatment that would indicate the effect of individual selection within populations upon adult numbers at 37 days. Accordingly, in this treatment one group of 16 adults was chosen at random from each
of the 48 C populations and a new population was founded with each group of 16. There could be no group selection in treatment C because there was no differential extinction or proliferation of the
populations. Changes in the mean number of adults produced in 37 days occurred rapidly, within three or four generations, and the differences between treatments were large in magnitude, at times
exceeding 100 adults per population (Fig. 2a). Group selection in the opposite direction (Table 1, and see below) to individual selection (compare A with C) produced an average difference of over 100
adult beetles per population. Group selection in the same direction as individual selection (compare B with C) so accelerated the rate of change of adult numbers that differences of over 60 adults per
population were observed. Just as individual selection requires that there be differences between individuals, group selection requires that there be differences between populations. The origin of
sufficient between-populations variance for group selection has been considered problematic in previous theoretical work (23, 24). Analysis of the D treatment populations, among which there were only
random extinctions, revealed a heretofore unrecognized source of between-populations variance. (It is emphasized that this between-populations variance is the sine qua non of group selection.) A

to alternative hypotheses. The human psyche is then characterized in terms of the probable reproductive significance of its different aspects, thereby generating additional hypotheses about its
